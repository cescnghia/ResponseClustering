"The WISE simulations allowed the students to conceptualize the abstract idea of invisible particles and see how the effects of these particles could be modeled and observed; the students were encouraged to work collaboratively and to reflect on their learning. These reflections especially allowed Jennifer to observe where the students were missing the big idea or were getting it. I loved how she observed that the kids loved her demos at the start, but it turned out that they learned nothing from them. How many times has that happened in my class and I didn't even know it?"
"The most effective aspects in wise activity were:\r\nCreating a spirit of team by encouraging collaboration with other partners,allowing student to make and test their own predictions,encouraging students to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations for the subject they are learning about. All these aspects helped students to be involved in the process of learning not only a receiver but a participant and an initiator.\r\n"
WISE uses predict-observe-explain patterns with prompts to encourage students to generate explanations.
It appears that the interactive app allowed them to visualize the science while reflecting on it as they went. Since it's difficult to show molecular activity in real size the WISE app seemed very useful.
Students can make predictions and test them. They work into small groups.
"One aspect of the WISE activity that really helped students was that it breaks down large chunks of information into manageable pieces. This way, students are able to focus on one concept at a time, and are able to digest it well before moving onto another piece. \r\n\r\nAnother aspect, WISE activities are hands-on, supported by available/appropriate materials and technology. They elicit a lot of discussion, generate ideas, accommodate sharing of knowledge, and allow the teacher to catch any misconceptions at the outset. The students remain engaged throughout the period.\r\n\r\nA WISE lesson is web-based, technology-driven, but student- and teacher-friendly. It encourages the students to think, investigate, inquire, predict, test, experiment, assess, comment, collect data, and reflect on their learning. The teacher can easily assess or track student learning and understanding, and he/she is able to stop work to hold spontaneous discussions.\r\n\r\nOne other great aspect, too, is that WISE is flexible and easy to modify. The teacher and the class can tailor their lesson to their needs. \r\n"
"I liked the idea of discovery. So many times, my students simply want to get to the answer"
The way it was interactive\r\nThe way it was visual\r\nIt offered assessment that does not stress students but it rather seems joyful and gives insight on hard topics and what needs more practise for the teacher
"WISE helps students to visualize and experiment with the physical terms in a way that would be difficult if not possible without technology. In the activity students could compare different scenarios safely while seeing the physical phenomenon animated in a clear way. Sometimes the animation is even better than doing the an experiment in real life, because with animation it is possible to emphasize processes that would be impossible to see with bare eyes. Also, with the ready made platform students were able to advance in their own pace, instead of waiting for the rest of the group."
"In addition to having students reflect on the knowledge they were gaining, I appreciated that they were out of their seats interacting with objects in the classroom. The lesson was not solely technology-based, but an effective marriage of technology and hands-on activities."
Integrated self-reflective questioning. Rich tangible examples. Provided students to make predictions and to discover their own answers.
"It is a web based, this means it is student pace. Students were engaged because of the simulation they were able to visualize."
"The visuals, where students could watch a model that explained heat transfer.  It's something they can't see, so the model helps them begin to visualize heat flow. "
I thought some of the aspects were keeping students engaged in lessons.  This type of teaching allowed the teacher to be more interactive and engaged in teaching students vise just lecturing.  This also help the students get a better understanding of what was in the lesson.  Easiest way to explain this aspect is teacher engaging and learning herself vise just sending her student to the text books.
I liked that the students could move at their own pace without having to bring the whole class back together. Students are being assessed as they work so a teacher would not have to stop the learning process to take a grade. The visuals also appeared helpful and the interaction with the visuals appeared meaningful. 
I think the most interisting feature of this technology is the capacity to break complex concepts in small manageable pieces of information
The simulations and diagrams seemed useful. I don't see how this is a novel feature though.\r\n\r\nAnd the ability to mask student names to discuss student work anonymously. Seventh graders are really subject to embarrassment so this is an important detail.
"The use of everyday, simple examples, such as the chocolate chips and the metal objects in their classroom, probably helped the students feel less intimated by the topic and also more connected.  Being able to work on their own also allows students to feel more connected to the topic, which makes them understand the topic better."
For the students to be able to have access to information and make predictions on what they think will happen with that information is great.  I think being able to test those predictions and see the result in real time is most effective.
Touching and feeling the temperature of different objects by students and learning heat flow the most effective  way to learn.
Chunked activities\r\nFeedback\r\nFrees teacher to move through small groups/ classroom while students working through sections
"The concept of scaffolding is very interesting to me. In another course The Science of Everyday thinking this concept was introduced to me. The ability to visualize components of concepts that culminate in a more comprehensive understand of the topic as a whole seems powerful. I know my personal understand of calculus didn't gel until running through 3 semesters of it and then the broader tool started to make sense. If WISE provides a structure to explore different components of a concept, then it could help students understand more complex topics.  Of course this is not necessarily applicable to simpler topics due to resource and time constraints."
that is is interactive and also allows them to use all their senses 
"In my perspective, the most effective aspect of the WISE activity is the reflections/ feedback between the teacher and the students."
"It was not possible to determine from the video. I would need to look at the resource in more detail. Most of the aspects could be delivered with less technology. For example, a well-scaffolded worksheet is critical - but it could have been in paper or Word format. Simulations are really useful - but I couldn't tell how good this one was. I saw a classroom that mostly showed students interacting with their computer. Is that better or worse than students interacting in small groups face-to-face?"
I though the visual of seeing the movement of heat was effective. I also thought the systems suggestion to go and explore was also effective. This allowing students to move around the classroom and engage in a different way. 
"The collection of data quickly and in small pieces allows teachers to see any Aha!'s or misconceptions that the students might be having in real time. Instead of guessing or only having one or two points in the lesson where you were collecting data from everyone, it was a constant flow of information to the teacher, rather a constant flow of information to the student. While that might seem counterintuitive, it allows the students to take control of their learning and the teacher takes the role of moderator, which is seeing that the scaffolding is truly meeting the students' needs and making adjustments as they go along."
I think the abundance of visual simulations would be effective in helping students learn the topics.
"The wise activities tailored to the students background knowledge and then furthering their understanding through simulations and reflections on their learning would be most beneficial to the students. This combined with real life activities and experiments would confirm learned content to the students. The testing of hypothesis in both scenarios, real life and simulation would deepen their understanding of concepts. Transparent reflections and receiving individualised feedback from the teacher would strengthen the student learning."
Some aspects of the WISE program that I thought was most effective in helping students learn topics was that it broke the lesson down into smaller pieces so that students could understand better. Another thing that I liked was the online simulation. Students could investigate without the threat of injury which can be a huge concern in the science lab with students working with heat.
I thought student become more engaged as the lesson went on. 
"I loved that they were able to revisit questions that they had answered previously and go deeper with their thinking. Also, this allows students to move at their own pace."
"Jennifer mentioned the various simulations as helpful, and what I saw of the WISE activity, the melting chocolate and burning a finger simulations were visually memorable. Jennifer also mentioned how WISE broke down the scientific concepts into small chunks that built up to a comprehensive knowledge in a methodical manner. I noticed how WISE used a method I've used in the past KWL - asking students before a lesson 'What do you think you know about this topic? and, What do you want to want to know about this topic?' After the lesson, I would ask, 'What did we learn about this topic?' I teach a survey of world religions and this method is really great at uncovering biases, misunderstandings, and incorrect notions of a topic before we begin."
"simulating and making some visual experiments in computer, and then experience then practically,\r\ngathering students' ideas and thoughts about the topic, make some activities and assignments for students\r\nonline and in my view the most interesting part was that the hard topics were broken into small simple parts\r\nthat will make it much easier for students to learn the topic."
"Students seemed to be working in pairs, so that everyone had a chance to use the equipment and be involved in measurement-taking. Many methods to deliver the instruction were used, including scaffolded computer tutorials mixed with the hands on labs. Students were grouped in tables of four and appeared to be allowed to discuss ideas and clarify with each other."
Tailoring lesson plans to suite students. Anonymous answer reviews - removes or reduces anxiety and stress for the weaker students which helps to prevent them from losing interest in the subject.
"I think the simulation are effective in letting students test their own thinking because they can run more tests in simulated experiments then in real time.  It is a tool in which a student can run through the we do part of a lesson until they grasp the concept and then move on to test in real time.  In this way the WISE activity meets the learning pace of individual students and provides a personalized learning experience.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the WISE activity that I thought was effective, was being able to monitor the students with the assessment tool.  This allows teachers to showcase thinking that is novel and innovative as exemplars without singling out the student.  \r\n\r\nThe continuous monitoring allows teachers to catch when and where students are getting stuck and then be able to stop the program and address emerging issues."
"The platform WISE is built on - though I have never actually seen it, from the pages shown on screen and through her narration - the lesson plans can be modified at any state of the instruction. Jump in and run the activity, make modifications as you progress or use other variables when to make modifications, alter how the class is conducted. It is a flexible platform."
"I consider that using simulations helps the kids a lot to understand concepts that could be hard to demonstrate  phisically. Also, the fact that they are able to predict what the result could be and debate their ideas in group in a collaborative way and confirm those ideas interacting with their surroundings, touching surfaces and objects and comparing them. In my opinion it's very effective once the kid is able to test their prediction in real life. \r\n\r\n"
"The stimulations that were provided through the WISE activity allowed students to learn and see examples of the science topic that was being covered. The WISE activity was a major factor in how students were able to cover the science topic and also allowed them to have discussions, be more of a critical thinker and be able to have questions and theories concerning the topic."
"The WISE activity kept the students engaged with inquiry and investigation. I particularly liked the observation Jennifer made about her classroom demonstration versus the WISE activities. For instance, the students seemed to develop deeper understanding when they watched the heating of the glass and metal rods. It was readily apparent which rod conducted heat better when they saw the chips melting."
"Firstly, the simulations that helped students to visualize the heat transfer in objects. As was pointed out, it is difficult for students to visualize heat so using technology to illustrate this was quite effective.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the idea of the students manipulating and interacting with the software helped students to learn the concept."
The simulations were great. They seemed to hold their interest. I also liked that there were questions for the students to answer so she could gauge their understanding.
"The WISE platform effectively structures the inquiry exercise for the students: it asks them to, in the words of Jennifer, reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners, and make and test their predictions. Particularly effective was the program's ability to engage the students in a variety of simulations, giving them the opportunity to connect the abstract and the concrete as the developed pictures in their minds and then touched the materials in the classroom to test theories. Also effective is the way the program breaks down concepts into small manageable pieces and then scaffolds them for synthesis by the students."
" I think that the use of various materials  and assessment tools ; lectures, videos, and some demonstrations in the classroom helps a lot the students to learn the topics and also to test their predictions."
"I think that the various examples using diagrams would be most effective.  For example, the portion using animation to show how heat is absorbed from skin would be easier for students to comprehend versus simply reading the information. I also thought that the activity seemed easily adaptable which is important as a teacher.  It was stated that the activity automatically scaffolded the lessons which would be perfect for a teacher to make sure that no students are left behind.  "
"Breaking down concepts and having kids experiment with them. The hands on approach has definitely given me good results, so I guess this time around it was the same."
The most important aspect were the possibility to visualize and test all the theory that was discussed previous in clads
Utilization of multiple avenues that allowed students to hypothesize and explore learning objectives is highly beneficial.  The ability for students to be exposed to effective frequency of key learning points made this activity very useful.
"As explained in the video, the students are encouraged to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations...rather than simply telling them the right answer."
"WISE ability to create simulation and in capturing the ideas and thinking process of the student that went behind the problem solving process is its biggest strength. This allowed the teacher to engage platform for meaningful discussion based on ideas generated by the learner itself. It generates a complete construct of the learning process by raising enquiry, capturing them and by using these to generate debate and further knowledge"
I thought that the simulations and visualizations were very helpful. There is an important difference between a one time teacher demonstration and something that you can look at several times at the students own pace and also understand more fully as their schema about the topic develops. 
The videos are are actually making the students to predict outcomes for thermodynamics topic.The asked to answer certain questions which are recorded and assessed by the teacher.The ideas of the students are tracked to know their understanding of the topic.Their assessment can be sent to them immediately.The challenging topics needs WISE as their tools.
"I was impressed first by giving the students the opportunity to test the different materials in the classroom - the learning did not just happen on a computer screen, but they were using more than one sense to learn the concept.  Secondly, the fact that the lesson is there ready to use is a huge benefit for me in that I don't have to start from scratch. My students will have the opportunity to use this and not wait for me to quit scratching my head trying to figure out how to design and implement such a lesson. For me, it turns a mountain into a mole hill."
"The WISE activity allows students to reflect on various scenarios, work collaboratively with peers and encourage them to investigate, measure and think of their explanations as they learn to make connections from their experience to the new ideas.  The WISE activity brings diverse experiences, perspectives, knowledge and skills to studentsÈ learning.  With the support of technology, students can visualize their learning. They become engaged learners who are active in their learning which helps students reach their full learning potential. "
I think the biggest benefit of WISE activities is that students can work at their own pace and can rewind when needed.  The visualizations also help students understand the concept they're exploring.
The different simulations and visual propronants seemed to have engaged the students in this lesson. It was a hands on interactive activity where the students had to predict and test their predictions.
"a) WISE helps the educator to guide the students to complete a task with their own exploration, experiment, and understanding\r\nb) WISE helps the student to be more independent and their thinking level increases.\r\nc) can ask the students to conduct their own experiment and come out with unique ideas"
Giving the teacher the opportunity to assess student imputs. this would help feedback processes and for tailoring instruction or further inquiry. 
"As a course developer for a local high school Chemistry course in Hong Kong, I find out that the simulation tools are very valuable and the visualization that comes with the simulation tools can indeed deepen the understanding of concepts in students' mind. In Hong Kong, high school students seldom have a chance to perform experiments in schools and visualization tools are not that readily available as local teachers do not have much time to explore the possibility of incorporating technology in their lessons. The WISE platform offers an easy way of managing course materials and monitoring students' progress within a lesson. I am also deeply impressed by the ease of giving feedback to students on the WISE platform. I think the teacher-student and student-student interactions are integral parts of the learning process. "
"WISE helps break down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students, and encourage them to build the ideas. "
"First, the most effective aspect is, in my opinion, the possibility to break down bits of information and making complicated structures, theories or ideas, simple and clear for students to comprehend. It also seems to be an extremely useful tool for differentiated activities, letting students work in their own pace and comfort. Another aspect I found interesting, is the fact that it's targeted on one specific topic, fully controlled and designed by the teacher, in a closed online environment (instead of 'distracting' platforms such as google or Wikipedia), in such as a way that lets the teacher track and collect all the students' work.  "
"Wise provides scafolding to students, breaks up difficult concepts into simpler ones. "
Some aspects of the WISE activity that I think were effective were the fact that Preparation and Materials were provided.  Students were briefed on their activities and expectations
That it breaks the topic onto small elements. it provides them with a lot of engaging simulations.
"because via WISE activity students can investigate, measure and think about possible explanations. In that way, students learn more effective."
"I like that concepts are broken down into small chunks and then scaffolded towards an understanding of the bigger, more complex idea. I assume that they get some sort of feedback and must show some competency before going onto the next level."
The students are allowed to explore and test new learning.  The materials allow students to self pace all the while allowing the teacher to follow along and include the class as a whole at times.
"When students are able to have a more active role in the lesson whereas before when there was a lecture, students would act only as spectators. Being involved in the lesson, by actively reading, writing answers, and looking at images allow students to access the information with a greater sense of involvement."
"I think using the scenarios and various examples helped show students exactly how thermal dynamics works. The example with the iron melting the chocolate chips shows the students how the transfer of heat works through various materials. The WISE program allowed students to be fully engaged which might not be possibly if the teacher was just providing an example in front of the class. Students were able to input their theories and see where they went wrong. They taught themselves, which made the students fully understand the topics.  "
"The students seem to engage with the broad range of activities involved in the WISE programme. What is most effective about it is that the activity allows them to be exposed to different scenarios, each one building on their understanding of the concept and then collaborate with each other which further consolidates this understanding. In reflecting on what they have experienced, their learning becomes deeper and it allows them to make it a personal learning experience. The fact that so many learning tools, activities and ideas can be carried out with a programme such as WISE, means that there is more of a chance for differentiation to take place among the different learners. This allows for all students to become involved. "
"I definitely think that the strong and pleasant visual and animation of the WISE activity is the most effective. In this way, students can have a deeper understanding even the most difficult or challenging topic because they can easily visualize and predict the movement based on how it is presented through WISE. \r\n\r\nThe activity can also make the student more keen and looking forward to class and find the course more interesting. "
The most effective things in WISE are lectures were downloaded in web-portal and demonstrations of thermodynamic effects. Homework in WISE is not very useful and effective.
"I liked that the students are guided by Web system to think about different scenarios, collaborate with partners, and to make and test their predictions. Students use simulation comparison. They also make forecasts."
"I thinks is very useful and motivating to students to do simulations, create predictions and then test their predictions"
"Interactivity, the fact that students could use virtual experiments in order to test science laws for themselves and actually get involved in the procedure of finding out what in their textbooks is called the theory section of their topics. "
interactive / effective / breaking concepts down in small pieces / visuals / free / available online
"The simulations allow the students to be in control of the activity and their learning. In addition, the teacher is able to monitor the students learning, allowing her to address those students that may need her help."
"I agrre with Jennifer when she sad that learn this topic is not easy, because to understand how we transmit heat is difficult, because we don't saw it, and the pictures and the diagrams helped the students create forms of understanding this subject. And the most important aspect is that the students are researchers of their own learning, and this allows that they learning to learn. "
"I really like the idea of having a program that breaks large, complex topics into manageable pieces.  I find that when I try to develop my own inquiry units, this is where I get stuck.  I end up spending so much time explaining the minutiae that we fall behind schedule and end up rushing what I think are the most valuable aspect of the inquiry lesson, the student reflection on learning.  It also appears as if (to a degree at least) students have the ability to self pace the modules.  I think its important for students to make discoveries in their own time or else they have no way of connecting to the material in a meaningful way.  I love the idea of student-centered/paced modules where students can take their time focusing the individual aspects that they feel they need to focus an reflect on and are not help to the pace of the rest of the students."
"The use of the web based format allowing collaboration and discussions amongst students encourages a culture of exploration and questioning.  The opportunity and encouragement to make, test and measure is invaluable in developing a mind-set of curiosity and inquiry as opposed to just accepting answers without any background knowledge and understanding."
The students were able to understand the concepts through simulations shown in WISE
challenging them through straight forward questions and making them think.
WISE helped students  to investigate for answers. They were given activities and were shown simulations which can be quite effectives for students. They were not just given the answers and told to memorize concepts. The students were actually given control of learning the material. 
The WISE activity focused on objects and occurrences that students were already familiar with: cooking and being in the kitchen.  The students were also asked to get out of their seats and touch different objects in the room which engaged more of their senses.  They were able to confront misconceptions (ex: things that feel cooler are at different temperatures) by using hand-held tools (digital thermometers).  
self paced learning - though this did rely on students having adequate literacy skills to work through the lesson on their own or in pairs. \r\nWell designed questions and illustrations as well as tasks and experiments students can conduct away from the computer. 
The students were able to collaborate and discuss ideas in small groups as they learned. It looked like the simulations and visuals would be helpful prep work for the students before they made their own predictions. I think testing and measuring temperature of real materials in the classroom was key before they went back to the technology for more explanations and illustrations of their experience. 
Providing visual simulations that were part of smaller scaffolded units seemed like the strongest affordance of WISE in this activity.
The ability to learn by failing fast. \r\nCollaboration with peers.\r\nWorking through exercises to develop conviction relating to theory.
"Jennifer states that the WISE program was able to break down the activities into small manageable pieces and then helped the students scaffold their understanding to build up the idea to present a more coherent understanding.  She also stated that the kids were completely engaged!! These two advantages of the program make this a very successful lesson. \r\nWhen I checked out the WISE web site there is also some teacher created videos on using WISE as a teaching tool.  I was able to find out that multiple students can sign in as a learning team but are graded separately as well as each question must be answered correctly for the student to move on to the next lesson (the chunking portion of the program). If a studentÈs answer is incorrect they are referred back to the source information before they can attempt to the answer a second time. Also, the program has some fail-safe protocol built in so that a student cannot change their answer once submitted.  \r\nI feel the ability to give individualized feed-back mentioned by Jennifer and on the introduction to the WISE site is a valuable teaching tool. The ability to give real-time, individualized feed-back is helpful for both students and teachers.  A teacher can just give a note of encouragement or to make the determination that their presence is necessary.\r\nChunking and building information to present a new idea is a tried and true method of teaching.  With the WISE program I also liked the ability to modify the information and questions so that you can differentiate the teaching for all ability levels of students.  From what I saw on the video and in my own research of the program this method of teaching appears to also be helpful with multiple learning abilities. To my thinking student engagement while learning is everything we hope for in a lesson! But with the added assessment tools, premade lessons, modification abilities and teacher interaction of this program it makes a comprehensive lesson.\r\n"
"The WISE presented students with the opportunity to run quick and visual simulations, stimulating them to predict the outcomes of the experiments and then checking their answers. That's a very valuable learning process."
"I think that the part where they experiment (the metal and the wood) was really effective. Also, students love working with electronic devices, so they get engaged in the learning process in a more independent  way. "
"I think that have the students be self guided and work at their own pace is beneficial. Also, it looked as though this activity allowed Jennifer to have the students work in smaller breakout groups. I like this because it allows the teacher to connect with students on a more personal level."
Some aspects of the WISE activity that would have been effective in helping students learn the topic were the prompts and interactions to have students explore and measure items in their classroom and the platform that appeared to allow formative assessment feedback to the teacher during the lesson.
"The simulations,  how the information was presented in ways that allowed for deep understanding of concepts through scaffolding, the assessment tools that allowed the teacher to track students ideas  and gauge how students are learning, the opportunity for instant feedback ."
The fact that the Wise cannot be used for the study of a whole unit.
"web based, work in partners or groups, simulations students can work at their own pace\r\n"
"The simulations seemed clear, although abstract. I wonder how younger students would go making connections from the simulations to the real world. I would want t o include plenty of hands on experiences to consolidate the new learning conceptually and concretely."
The WISE activity enabled Jennifer to act as a facilitator and mentor students.
"I thought that the section where they had to make predictions about how hot/cold various materials would feel then actually test their predictions in the classroom was an effective aspect of this unit.  Hands on activities help learners, especially tactile learners, make sense of a concept as it relates the things that they might interact with on a daily basis-metal, wood, etc.\r\nI also thought the melting chocolate activity was an effective aspect of the unit.  Once again, it relates to materials/items that students would encounter in their everyday lives."
I like the activity was a collaborative activity to further what was already taught in class.  It was effective because of the simulations that the students were able to see and the reflections that they were asked to do.
"The most  effective aspects of the WISE activity were  the different simulations that gave students a picture in their mind of how to see a heat moving through a system. The WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small manageable pieces, and then it helps students to build  those ideas up to a more coherent understanding."
I think the way she used it as a review. She walked around and was able to monitor what the students understood. She was able to monitor and adjust.
"I think that having an opportunity to run simulations would greatly deepen understanding. The students' learning was differentiated (videos, lectures, discussion) to support a range of learning styles too. "
"Students can activate their schemata about the topic by describing what they know about it, and also applying such knowledge to make predictions., thus developing their critical thinking.\r\n\r\nStudents have the opportunity to experiment and interact with the material both virtually and physically , so getting a better understanding of the topic."
"Ability for students to discuss with the teacher at points in the inquiry. The visual pieces which brought an abstract concept to life and supported visual learners was also important. Finally, as Jennifer mentioned, it appeared to be structured to allow students to travel many paths in the discovery section of the inquiry."
I liked how it was fragmented into manageable sections.  I also thought the the visuals would be very helpful.  
I really liked the fact that the teacher was able to personal a lesson so it met student prior learning and experiences.  I also like the fact that students could make their way through the lesson at their own pace.
"1) a variety of inquiries - visual, models, experiments  2) teacher control to stop the activity and do a check for understanding 3)  customizable - change units, remove items."
" I think the transition of seeing a visual model demonstrating a scientific concept on-screen to being able to engage in tactile learning (by touching different materials of the same temperature) to immediately apply what you've just seen is extremely effective. It's a perfect way of applying the 'learn by seeing, then doing' principle.\r\n\r\nAs Jennifer stated in the video, the effectiveness of the activity also stems from the fact that initially, concepts are presented in small, manageable chunks and are eventually synthesized to present a coherent bigger picture. I think this is a much more effective way of presenting science topics than the norm, which is to introduce a complex scientific term and concept, and sequentially break it down. Students can initially feel intimidated that way and that fear may color their understanding throughout the lesson.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously, small student groups are always the best way for promoting reflective discussion.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for formative assessment by looking at the WISE teacher's interface without moving around and making students aware of your presence was also a great feature of the activity, allowing Jennifer to pause the lesson at appropriate intervals for a class-level discussion."
"simulation to understand the concept of heat,collaborate the student together\r\n  "
WiSe help students to imagine the real situation using animation. Students also can demonstrate all of the possibility about the things that students questioned. 
I really liked the fact that WISE activity helped Jennifer's students to break the concept into pieces. When we try to understand a relatively difficult concept breaking it  helps the students to have a nuanced understanding of the concept as a whole. I also liked that the teacher had full control over the WISE activity and that she could put pause wherever she thought was required for her students and with the help of WISE assessment tool she was also able to provide immediate feedback to children in from of comments.   
"That they made predictions, tested stuff in their actual classroom as well as through web-based simulations"
"Well I found the interactive simulators to be most effective aspects of the WISE platform. Allowing the students to experiment and apply their own understanding to the concepts that they have just learnt.\r\nIn addition to the collaborative nature of the program where by students are given the opportunity to work together and establish teams to tackle certain areas of their understanding.\r\nThe ability for the instructor to cater and construct the activities to target her students abilities and level, also seems to be quite and effective aspect that would aid any classroom, special mixed ability groups.\r\nI also enjoyed that the students had the ability to relate the wise simulators to real life objects, there by giving the more kinaesthetic students the ability to move around the classroom and experiment with real life objects.\r\nThe step by step support is also quite and efficient aspect, and the ability for the teacher to maintain and monitor her students progress thereby step in an aid when needed, is a key aspect that would help in any classroom."
The WISE activity is very interesting and new for me.  I haven't heard about it before and I consider it's a useful tool which really engages our students in the process of searching the possible results and makes it easier to understand concepts.
"WISE gives the students confidence to participate in the classroom activity as well as engage themselves in the class discussion. I think this is a plus since not all of the students has the confidence to say what they wanted to say in front of other students. With the help of this approach, they'll be able to share their ideas directly to the teacher just like a normal recitation. \r\nAnother good thing is that students come up with the answers. They are given the freedom to discover, observe, and understand new concepts and ideas through collaborations and partnership with other students. "
"Small groups,visual examples, specific questions set by teacher based on things tgat were done in class. "
The WISE project helps students to find answers by inquiring and experimenting rather than just putting the answer before them. It emphasises on a research effort by students that encourages them to try new and different things.
Having nice visuals to explain abstract concepts.\r\nEncouraging students to relate virtual lessons to real life experiments.\r\nEngaging students in the learning process.
"Activities were scaffolded to help deepen understanding.  The simulations provided a contextual framework for them to understand where the concepts might apply.  Students could review and go back and watch simulations again, and working collaboratively helped increase engagement.  The teacher was able to show and share all students thoughts and ideas to everyone anonymously which allowed a safer environment for those more quiet or reluctant students to take the risk to share their opinions.  "
"The aspects of the wise activity IS full of materials, lectures, simulations. So her students have the ability to understand better the lesson."
"I like the anonymized project of student work she could do.\r\nIt is also enormously important that it could be highly customized, but also was able to be simply run out of the box -- as she said, this meant that she could do it the first time without having to change a lot, and yet she could also, in future versions, make extensive customizations.  It is nice that these customizations can also be shared with colleagues."
I think that the ability for students to run some simulations and think about possible results before actually doing it in the classroom made it more concrete and allowed the students to really think about what was happening as opposed to just having the teacher tell them the answers.
"I felt that combining online simulations of how heat is transferred along with the real, tactile experiment of touching different materials of the same temperature is an effective way to have students investigate theory and then see how their models fit with experience.  The WISE activity allows for students to see the science that is going on in heat transfer, and the activities are designed in such a way that facilitates inquiry learning (the learning gap isn't too far or too close for students to logically use information they already knew with the information they have just acquired to build their model of heat transfer).  Also, being able to have class discussions about ideas as students are forming models of heat gives instant feedback to help further develop the students' storyline of heat transfer. "
"Its a served as a different means of teaching a lesson, allows students to experiment on their own and test out things to be able to come up with their on hypothesis and results. Using WISE for challenging lessons is very helpful because it allows students to explore (inquire), apply and conclude; covering all lesson objectives."
"I enjoyed the fact that the site didn't just give the students the answer; it guided them to discover the answer by making them do the work.  I also enjoyed the fact that this was accessible to the teacher as the students were completing the assignment,so that she could interject with questions online to further the discussion.  With these elements, students were able to think on a more in-depth level, thus embedding that knowledge."
"The hands on application allows for students to critically think and process with peers and the teacher. Using the students current  thinking on the concept presents fantastic opportunities for discussion and lessons that move their thinking forward. Hopefully, discussions on real world applications of the knowledge also came into play. Collaboration among peers also allowed them to process their knowledge as it is happening. "
I particularly think that it a simulation process was really helpful to students learn about the thermodynamic concept. because he would be able to predict what would happen on different surface material. And finally apply the concept in real experiences.
"Jennifer shared a lesson that posed challenges for her grade 7 age students. This is because any discussion of heat requires students to visualize what is occurring at the atomic level. Students in grade 7 are still at the concrete level of learning - that is, it is easiest for them to formulate an explanation of a phenomenon if they can create a model that they can touch or manipulate somehow using their own hands. This is not possible with heat even when a microscope is used.\r\n\r\nAspects of the technology that I thought were effective were:\r\n1. The use of collaborative group work: students of grades 7 through 11 learn best in small groups which challenge students to think together about the data that is presented and make sense of it together.\r\n2. scaffolding learning based on student reflections and measurements- because the data is collected for assessment and the next activity presented is based on a group's or individual's interpretation of data, this helped keep students focused on the lesson goals and their understanding. This gave the teacher a certain amount of flexibility to move around the room and monitor student progress and understanding.\r\n3. The assessment tool allowed collection of data to be used for assessment and/or evaluation. This could be used as either diagnostic or formative assessment. Perhaps it could be used as summative assessment as well?\r\n4. I liked the prediction and reflection boxes for students to record what they thought the temperature of different types of objects in the classroom would be, along with the explanation box. This would allow the teacher to easily assess whether the majority of students understood that every material in the classroom was in fact the same temperature even though cardboard objects would feel warmer than metal ones due to conductance.\r\n5. I liked the function that allowed the teacher to freeze student screens to focus their attention to the front of the room to look at individual student answers and/or data.\r\n6. I liked the aspect of this program that allowed the teacher to easily copy and modify the activity to meet the particular needs and motivations of her cohort. Further to this she was able to share her changes in the program with her colleagues."
"First, simplify the terms. Sometimes, I believe that is hard to understand the big picture if we are not available to understand the little pieces. However, when you have a friendly (and easy) way to learn the small parts, the big picture seams doable. I like that in the video, students seems to be learning while having fun. I think that is a great strategy; simplify."
"The oportunit that they have to discover bay thenselves the concepts, measuring for exemple"
"The WISE activity allowed students to make predictions and to test their ideas about the movement of heat.  They were also testing their ideas in a variety of contexts, using different materials. The technology gave the opportunity for them to receive immediate feedback on their work, also, through the programmed lessons or the teacher."
"The lesson was divided into smaller segments, allowing for student scaffolding. The opportunity for teachers to modify the lesson is a significant benefit, as the lesson can be tailored to suit the group dynamic and learning needs."
It was interactive and a safe way for students to do experiments prior to working with real materials. It also is very adaptable to the particular needs of the class. 
"I personally feel that simulations are the most helpful part of this activity. Furthermore, asking students for predictions is also an effective and important aspect."
"Being fun and student-centered. Having lots of visual aids. Promoting creative thinking, analysis and problem-solving."
I think the way that the difficult concepts were 'chunked' played a big part in helping Jennifer's students understand this difficult topic. 
"I think the most effective ones were that it has visual aids and therefore, students were able to see processes that actually they were not allowed to see with their own eyes. The chance to see, to touch materials and to experiment on their own shows us that they have a great capacity to understand and catch topics that only theoretically explained cannot be possibly understood. Moreover, the teacher helped them engageing the lesson because she has prepared this activity in a way that students are involved with the topic and hence they can explain and transmit their feelings and thoughts. "
"I liked the like visual application , the reports and the method how you can take a text and transform into anonymous and puts it back into digital whiteboard for students.\r\nI use nearpod and this feature I am unaware it exists.\r\nI found very interesting video simulating the heating of the bar until the chocolate melting ."
"The inquiry learning. I mean, students had to find data by their own experiences and note the result in WISE. For the student who it was harder to understand the teacher visual experience, WISE is really effective with the simulation. Student can watch and rewatch simulation in WISE platform and Jennfer think that it was more integrated in them by this way."
The simulation of situations allows students to understand more clearly what is being studied. The teacher monitors and identifies possible difficulties that students may present.
I like that the simulations were paired with actual experiences in the room.  Students had the visuals and actual first-hand experiences.
Students share and are able to analyze their learning and reflect on tit.
"E- Learning and online assessment and evaluation will most importmant for education.\r\nWISE activity that you thought were most effective, in terms of helping students learn the topics because of that.\r\n"
"Co-operation, documention. Myself IÎm using e-notebooks, so they can make also their own remarks. Visual effect (which you canÎt show from the normal text book) are important. Own experiences plus good animations are working together."
1.Learning were able to learn on their own.\r\n2.It was possible to look into work of each student.\r\n3.It helps in critical thinking.
"The ability to test their understanding, the small chunks provided, the different ways of engaging students nd being able to tailor the activity"
They are inquiry method-students learn by simulation and authentic material to find out the answers by themselves; tool assessment-they can get quick answer feedback or comments from teacher; and great record-the teacher can trace the students' learning reflection through the record if they understand the lesson or not. This will further help them for particular points they do not understand. 
WISE allows students to work collaboratively in their own pace and gives teacher real-time access to student's progress in formative assessment.  
"Being guided by a web based system students are made to think critically, making predictions and simulations bringing them into the lesson and making them learning by experiencing.having a technological support and scaffolding for their learning."
Multiple scenarios and simulations. Interactivity with the material. Focused subgroup discussions. 
"students engaged, learn in small steps, handle abstract concepts in more concrete animations or by direct mesurements, teachers can give immediate feedback, ... "
The aspects of the project that seems effective and interesting is that students can experience in practice what they are learning.
"Students going back and forth from activities to real world trials/experiments, from group to individual work and from student-initiated to teacher-initiated activities."
It helps the pupils more engaged and bring an active classroom experimentation more exciting. the processes of each instructions given by the WISE is indeed a fun learning activity for the students to be more involved and becoming more interesting the experiment given to them.
"I think the WISE activity is an excellent tool.  However, all students learn in a different fashion as most teachers know so we will see how it goes. "
"1. WISE activity  breaks down concepts into small manageable parts. \r\n2. It presents students with opportunities to make their own investigations related to the concepts. \r\n3. It presents opportunities for students to predict about situations, exercise own ideas, reflect on them. In the process students develop a deep understanding of the concept. \r\n4. Wise activity is amenable to modifications by the class instructor to meet students' needs. "
WISE provides learners the opportunity to discover things on their own which makes learning more meaningful. Another aspect is how the information and set of exercises in an organized manner which enhances the learners critical thinking skills in a creative way. 
"Engaging - using examples that are meaningful, tangible and interesting to students. \r\nExperiential- Students learned by doing. They predicted, experimented, measured and touched the objects in the class.\r\nInteractive - Many opportunities to process the information and construct their own understanding by asking questions and collaborating with their peers. Students learn more by working through a problem collaboratively than by going at it alone. "
"I like the fact that students were encouraged to investigate, measure and make predictions, and not just offered the final answer. I thought it was great that they had the opportunity to collaborate with partners and learn about other ideas their classmates were generating. "
"The WISE activity was effective for students because it allows them to reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners, and make and test their predictions. It allowed students to run experiments that would normally take a long amount of time. It also had students test their predictions by doing hands-on activities around the classroom not involving the computer to solidify their understanding by making it real to them. The program also encourages students to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations instead of just telling them the answer."
Being able to visualize the flow of heat and combining this with observations they could make at the macroscopic level.
"web based systems and giving assignments, projects and also making the students to learn from doing experiments."
"visuals, daily relatable experience, personalisation of knowledge with first hand information."
"Excited to hear about WISE platform. It is a good tool to organise the whole lesson. Starting from the curriculum, videos, exercises and some autonomy for learners interaction. "
"mostly the guidance of students,  but also a little bit the guidance of teachers\r\n"
Approaching real situations and suits individual needs and understanding concepts and predictions.
"It's hard to get a good sense of the WISE platform from the video. It's a good overview, but without being able to dig into  it myself, it's difficult to answer this question effectively. I'd have to take Jennifer's reflection as a way of informing the effective aspects of the WISE platform, that is, that it allowed students to solidifying their understanding of the concepts through virtual experimentation, that it scaffolded the learning for the students, and from the looks of it, students were able to work in pairs to work through the tasks. There's no mention of how the students were grouped, so it's hard to know what impact that had on building student understanding."
Testing progress section Testing progress section Testing progress section Testing progress section
I think the area where students explored in melting chocolate chips and touching an iron with different bars made of glass and metal really gave a huge understanding to the students. 
"Using WISE students were able to practice. I believe when students put the theory into practice, they are able to learn effectively."
"Groups working and hands on. When students have the chance to really feel the science behind usual objects and situations, they find a meaning and reason to learn.  "
"Any time students can see and then apply/do, you're working to create an environment of understanding. I appreciated the visuals and templates provided by WISE, but really appreciated the fact the kids were not just screen timing it the entire lesson - students were seeing and doing. "
"The way the content was broken down and used. Also, it allowed the teacher to work with students in smaller groups and get a better feel of how the students were understanding the material."
The visualizations of concepts that might otherwise be difficult for students to conceptualize. I am also intrigued by the possibility of the program collecting student input/answers/ideas in a way that's manageable for the teacher to review and give feedback on.
Use of prediction based on reading/study.  Then experimenting with objects in the room.
"It seemed as though a notable benefit of the platform was that broke the topic down into manageable chunks that students could work on at their own paces. The fact that it also allowed Jennifer to monitor students' progress in real time (or close to it) seemed quite valuable as she could pause, tweak, or discuss the lesson/topic as needed, based on the patterns through which students were progressing. "
"Visualization and simulation, experimentation when the objects that might be needed were not at hand."
"Helps students to go about a self inquiry process and space to fill in their ideas, responses and helps students in breaking down the concepts into a simpler blocks"
"wise platform help students to learn  the topic in ana interactive way,they can make simulations split the topic in small ides and understad each idea to more understand the top.and the teacher can see all kind of ideas an explination that students gives on the platform."
That fact that it could be self paced and allowed for collaboration as well as individual inquiry.  The teacher was able to engage with students as they were doing things instead of after the fact.  She could pause the learning to reflect on what they had already understood and show interesting points brought up by other students even though they weren't working as a class.
"investigate and think of possible answers, able to differentiate to focus on areas of need for each student, students use own ideas and then investigate to understand, with difficult topics using WISE activities students are more engaged and will understand and learn more about the specific topic.  The simulations the WISE activities provided gives students visualizations that help some students learn and develop a deeper understanding"
"Where the students had to prove understanding of the material through WISE. That alllows them to personally address some issues with their learning process, allows them to be more engaged in their own learning."
"I liked the ability to participate in experiments via animations online, also special gaps for reflections was left. The web resources were well integrated into practical learning experiences in the class, which were designed by the teacher,"
"the wise activity is chuncks the material in small pieces for the students, making it easier for them to understand. also, the lesson is visual with animations, which make the learning stick. \r\nstudents experiment themselves, and learn by doing that. "
The aspects of the WISE activity that I thought were most effective are:\r\n-\tPractice: student are practicing when having the lecture\r\n-\tEngage student in learning through discussion groups\r\n-\tStudents are those who are in charge of conducting the experimentation\r\n-\tTurn the classroom to an active learning environment\r\n
I think that having at their disposal lots of materials to touch and experiment with allow the students to immediately check any hypothesis they can propose and have an immediate feed-back.\r\n\r\nAlso the possibility of working in couples or small groups and having the possibility to comment their ideas with a peer helps them to learn or to build their own learning.
"I think the WISE activity were most effective is simulations because it is very hard to understand physical concepts when we can't visualize them. In Italy we use to teach mathematical, physical and chemestry formulas that describe the concepts the students have to know but they are offten only an abstract concept. I think that the most important fact in learning is deep understanding and simulations help to understand very well."
"1.\tScaffolding of the learner research into manageable chunks \r\n2.\tTeacher being able to access  the learnerÈs ideas by using the assessment tool, thus making tracking easier for  her  knowing what kinds of ideas that learners are being bought into the lesson plus tracking the way as their understanding develops. (Formative Assessment) \r\n3.\tTeacherable moments as she roved the learnign space - to hold spontaneous discussions\r\n4.\tThe assessment tool allows the teacher to send them quick comments to students regarding their work - immediate feedback.\r\n5.\tRecord keeping - track of learners progress, collects learners reflections and measurements, and scaffolding their learning therefore the teacher is able to make ongoing professioanl judgements about  the learners learning. \r\n6.\tTeacher has more time to rove and listen, talk, and stimulate the  learners while they are doing their inquiry learning   that is allows for differentiation \r\n"
"Having watched the video, I think that WISE is a very effective tool for students as well as teachers. It encourages the students to investigate and think for themselves, and as was stated in the end, it breaks down a difficult concept to small manageable parts, which helps the students to grasp the idea which was not quite easy to understand. I also noticed the visualization tool, which is probably quite good for students, especially young ones."
applying various scenarios of different materials and came with real life cases we meet in our daily life
"The WISE activities are interactive and encourage students to make predictions, this is crucial in supporting critical thinking skills. When a student makes a prediction it means that they are drawing on previous knowledge. This helps organize information in their head and also gives teachers clear ideas about the students thinking process. \r\n\r\n The fact that the teacher can monitor student's progress and is provided with a permenant log that can be used to review students progress is really helpful. This allows the teacher to reflect on the areas in which students are progressing and also identify the concepts which commonly cause difficulties. The teacher can then use further classes to address these conceptul difficulties. \r\n\r\nAnother great teaching tool which the WISE programme provides is the ability to pull out ideas from the studentÎs work and share them on the screen with the class. This can be used to encourage students to peer assess each others work and collectively anaylse either correct thinking of address common flaws or new and interesting ideas which come out of the whole process. \r\n\r\nThe programme also allows differentiation as it can de edited and adapted. It has uses visual aids as well as encouraging writing. There are things for all different kinds of learners. It also allows students to work at their own pace and not that of the fastest student. \r\n\r\n We also saw in the video that students were taking the concepts they were learning about through the programme and applying them to the real world around them. They were exploring the materials in the classroom. \r\n\r\n"
"What I thought was effective is breaking down the information for students.  Also, the video shows examples of the finger and bowl explaining how heat transfers with arrows was effective.  Not being able to see the heat transfer with the naked eye is a hindrance to students to understand the concept.  With the video visual and demonstrations students were able to understand the information more effectively. "
"The WISE activity focused on developing students' conceptual understanding of thermodynamics, and not just an understanding of facts about the topic.  Also, since formative assessment questions were embedded in the WISE activity, the teacher was able to address student misconceptions in the moment."
"Self-directed learning required from the students to discover about heat transfer and how it affects how different material feels upon touching. \r\n\r\nThe step by step process, as well as the online demonstration and the interactive models available on the website that students can make use of to see heat transfer. \r\n\r\nUsing WISE as a review also allowed the teacher to gather information and pick up wrong concepts that students might have during the course. "
"In my point of view the concept of this course is thermodynamics-- heat flow and materials, heat capacity and heat transfer. it is a very good technique. This way student can explor their own and get a very clear ideas.\r\n"
"I think the simulation is an important and powerful feature that allow students to experience the concepts. They see the natural phenomena more easily. In addition, the WISE platform facilitates working groups, enabling sharing information and doing projects tasks in groups."
"Students use the computer to learn, not only to enjoy. OK, to enjoy learning, no to waste their time.\r\nStudents have to get a product working together.\r\nStudents can find out that on the Internet there are good webs and bad webs."
"As Jennifer said, it seems that was very effective to provide students the opportunity to visualize closer the physical phenomena using gifs and pictures, also complementing the activity by pratical experiments. WISE is a very powerfull tool that can assist during science lessons due to the natural obstacle of some particulars subjects that demands a high power of visualization and belief. "
Students were very engage and were able to share their experiences and connect their ideas into coherent understandings.
"One thing I really liked and thought was important was how WISE broke down the topic into smaller, manageable pieces and allowed the lesson to be scaffolded, building on each previous concept so students can make connections."
"a. Real time simulations to help students understand the concept with practical example\r\nb. Encourages students in investigate, measure and think about the possible explanation\r\nc. Access various kinds of given by students\r\nd. Encourages differentiation instruction\r\ne. Self paced learning for students\r\n\r\n"
learning by doing is an incredible way to teach and WISE  was very good bcuse cathched student interest wich is one of the most common problem nowdays in our schools\r\n 
"Through seeing the changes via simulations , students can understand  the topic more easily.Answering questions or experimenting which object's temperature is high is very interesting and i think they are all effective. "
"Breaking down the concepts, building the topic up, and allowing for testing their hypotheses and doing experiments learning was fostered."
"I think WISE activity gave the students an opportunity to learn thought experimentation, they could word in groups, interacting, sharing experience and engaging discussion. This way helped them learn autonomously."
"The Wise program doesn't just try to tell students the right answer, but rather encourages them to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.  It also allows the instructor the opportunity to track progress in real time and provide comments/feedback. "
I think the most important  aspect is the possibility of dividing the information into small pieces that can be better understood by students. Also the comments the teacher can make that allow control better the process of understanding. The discussion in small groups leadered by teacher is also a great idea. That is how student get involved in the activity and that leads to deep learning.
"WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students, scaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up to a more coherent understanding."
"WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, gave them a picture in their mind of how to see the heat moving through a system. And then it helps the students, scaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up to a more coherent understanding. \r\n"
Letting the students to implement their ideas freely and even demonestrating it
Some of the aspects of the WISE activity that I thought were most effective were that it was student driven. It also gave the teacher the freedom to redirect the learning when needed and hold small group discussions about the material. I agree with the teacher that it was a great way to review the material. 
The experimenting aspects. They were able to make predictions and test if those predictions were significantly right 
- breaking down the concepts into smaller units\r\n- assessing the learning outcome\r\n- engaging students in the activity
I appreciate the tools for reflections which is often lacking in many tools. Students need to see their past work more than teachers ... have time... to review it. \r\nThe interactivity also adds emphasis to the key concept and may identify important misconceptions.
Trackingadapt  the way that students understanding develops and learn from them about what they're thinking and how they're responding to the materials.
"It seems to be a great tool that helps the students learn independently, concentrate on the research (here: inquiry) and collaborate to make progress. The teacher can monitor their students annonymously not to distract as well be part of the team."
"The WISE activity breaks the concept of heat into pieces and helps vizualize it, students can do simulations, put forward their own ideas and give explanations, compare results and collaborate, while the teacher can monitore the discussion, see where students need some help to move forward, and adjust the activity to students' needs."
"I think the most important thing I could see in WISE is that students are not only consuming a huge amount of information but they also are practicing it. The example is clear, when they touch a surface and the temperature feel they can check what they are learning through the program."
Students being able to see and work at their own pace. Go back and revisit. visualise. Teacher to modify lessons. 
One aspect that I thought was effective was that WISE broke down difficult concepts into chunks that were then used to scaffold the students knowledge.
"I thought the simulations and the detailed graphics of the concepts were really powerful for students. As she said it explained a concept that is difficult to understand as molecules are not visible but the graphics demonstrated what the molecules were doing to make the concept easier to grasp. The simulations were a good way for students to explore how the different concepts work. With this, students are better able to discern one from the other in context."
WISE allows understanding and comprehending the topic better as WISE allows you to break down concepts into manageable pieces. Students have the opportunity to engage more frequently.
"WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the student scaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up to a more coherent understanding.\r\nThe WISE lesson let students really develop a deeper understanding of the concept of heat.\r\n Students are completely engaged\r\n"
"Allowing learners to discover what the concept is. For example, in this lesson, the teacher want to teach how fast heat travels through different materials. So she uses some materials in the class and ask the learners to do an experiment and find how fast heart will travel through different materials such as iron, wood, plastic and glass by themselves. In this lesson, the teacher uses simulation technique which is very effective in that learners are motivated to find out something by themselves rather than letting someone to tell something or an answer."
I really liked how the WISE activity allowed the teacher to change or take out sections of the lesson to suit the curriculum needs and the needs of the children. It shows that it is important to identify opportunities for using technology in the classroom. It was good to see an example of technology use that enabled application of concepts rather than simply replacing gathering knowledge. 
engaging for students which increases their receptiveness to information presented
"I think specially in science it is difficult to get a good understanding of abstract concepts. Very often students only understand more complex ideas if they can visualize them in a more active way. Breaking the whole concept of heat into smaller pieces of visual information is in my opinions very helpful. They literally see the whole process which is normally hidden to their eyes. And that helps to understand and to be more conscious about a concept like heat that is part of our daily routine. Also the possibility to feed the lesson with teacher questions is a very interesting aspect. Teachers can move the whole learning process into specific directions depending on the feedback they get from their students. That makes teachers directly take part in the reflections and processes their students are engaging in, in real time."
Virtual-Reality by Simulations\r\nVirtual Laboratory\r\nAnimated challenging content\r\nEngaged Classroom\r\nPredictions and writing observations\r\nQuiz and Assessments
"The WISE activity has been planned as a web based activity which helped the teacher to remain connected with the students while they experiment or do activity. This helped the teacher in regular assessment. In a WISE activity students are put to real life situations to observe, reflect and react. They make predictions and test their predictions for results. During the activity, they go through a progress of observation, study and analysis. This helps them gain more than the academic knowledge. They are able to relate their classroom experiences with the real life experiences."
"Thermodynamics in the kitchen, where they use simulations to compare heat transfer through different materials. Using assessment tool to send them quick comments about their work, so they will learn if they are on the right track."
I think interactive models were very helpful for students who find difficult to understand some scientific concepts and also to apply these concepts to the real world objects.
*Breaking down complex concepts into small manageable pieces so that students can easily digest the topic\r\n*effective involvement of the students\r\n*easy share with the peers
"* Working in groups, making predictions, testing their predictions.\r\n* Students were encouraged to investigate, measure and think of possible explanations.\r\n* Students were completely engaged from the beginning till the end of the lesson."
"Students can test, experiment, share information and complement what is being worked in the classroom. "
- Students can make simulations of the topics they are learning.
"Seems that it was very engaging. Students can do the demonstrations (simulations) for themselves, so it more inidvidualised which certainly helps.\r\nAlso learning material is broken down to smaller pieces, so it's more manageable to understand and learn."
Allowing students to explore on their own is invaluable! It allows them to alleviate questions in a one-on-one way--especially important since most teachers don't have the luxury of being one-on-one.
"The simulations were of great help to the students, since they helped the teacher to break down each concept into small pieces. This lead to an in depth understanding of the material tackled."
The use of simulations and visuals to comprehend concepts that are abstract or not seen with the naked eye. Direct instruction was limited but during the activity the teacher could pause the screens for discussions.
"being able to specify content relative to the student's background, and what was covered in previous lessons.  Also the ability to place students in a position to test their knowledge and to learn what they know.   "
"I find it interesting and more effective because the students must find the answers for themselves, as the exemple they must touch several materials to find the temperature and what t's the explanation. If you use different sources  of information you have more possibilities to learn it. I think you can do this activity  regardless of the characteristics of the students, both those gifted as low."
"Implementing visuals and graphics, and bringing objects in the class for more realistic understanding."
"WóçSE activity helping the students that they could exersise some of their ideas and build  more coherent understanding of events. Some experimentss are  hard, expensive and dangerous for students to visualize , so having all this perfect simulations gave to students a picture in their mind. And WóçSE lessons really let students develop understanding and imagine skills. if students love demostrations, they enjoy and understand easly. So WISE is huge development for  understanding, making and testing their prediction."
"The interactive activities plus the ability to reflect.  I loved that the teacher could pull up their thinking to discuss as a whole class - this reminds me of the Bansho  in math.  This helps bring out misconceptions and through discussion as a class, ideas can be synthesized and fleshed out to be more whole."
"Some of the aspects of the Wise activity I found effective was the exceptional lessons and resources at your fingertips.  Students are involved in relevant activities that investigate many hands-on experiments and are able to analyze and evaluate the results.  Student collaborations key to the process.  The teacher's role is changed, by being given more time to interact ad individualize learning while also keeping a much better idea of the direction and understanding of the class as a whole.  "
"Teachers immersed in planning and supported to enhance a repertoire of instructional design and delivery\r\nskills and technological competence are challenged to grow as professionals. They hone their instructional decision making, including their ability to select and incorporate technology, to develop educational environments which results in significant student learning.\r\n"
Very engaging. \r\nPupils can learn at their own pace. \r\nPupils work in pairs or small teams.
"Considering this particular lesson was difficult for the students to grasp, I think WISE was a great resource in that it segmented the lesson into mini-units that were easier to grasp and that built off of one another. Students were able to gain a deeper understanding of the material presented through WISE and then apply it to the real world, i.e., touching objects in the classroom to determine temperature. In addition, it took the information provided in the textbook (presumably) and presented it in an interactive format that all of the students were familiar with. "
"The WISE helps the students to make their own ideas of a topic. We, as teacher, can use it with several activities and graphics so they can help the students to understand abstract topics because the can break them into pieces and then, with those pieces, they can make their own idea."
"the simulation part, i felt it will form images in the mind of the children, helping them connect with the concept the more, bringing it to life."
Having access all of their student's ideas using the assessment tool.\r\nTracking the way that their understanding develops\r\nStundents can develop a deeper understanding of concepts.\r\n
"I think that having that simulation previously and trying the experiment later, really helped students to make some predictions on their own instead of having an explanation from the teacher. By predicting they start to get some ideas about some facts that they can later try by doing the experiment and then see if what they predicted is true, false or simply different to what they expected. Wise also fosters studentsÈ reflections and collaboration since they have to investigate, measure and think. That makes them to get their own conclusions."
"Students could visualise the processes of heat flow, heat capacity and heat transfer, which helped them to understand the concept of heat. They could present their explanations, make predictions and test them, all these activities teach ctudents to think independently and develop their critical thinking."
"I think active learning and discovery are essential to true learning vs memorizing concepts. The use of learning in small meaningful pieces and scaffolding the pieces is great. I will need to look at more, but think the WISE platform is good for learning concepts. The idea of the student seeing the progress of groups and the whole through technology is great. "
"In my opinion the key aspects of WISE for building a more effective learning process are: 1) it is possible to personalize the tool according to the students caracteristics and needs; 2) the fact that it focus the process in the inquiry, not in the answer, that's why the students are estimulated to research, learn and apply the concepts; 3) it makes possible the assimilation of abstract concepts by showing them to the students in a perspective that make the ideas more visible (for example: atoms and particles, that can't be seen)."
"I think Simulations help student to understand concepts because when they use the simulation tools they actually can change different variables, then run the simulation again and observe what happens next. Simulations also help students to make predictions and afterwards to check them.\r\nAnother important point is that complex concepts are broken into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are easier to grasp their meaning. Pupils can pause and run the simulation at their own pace. \r\nAll in all, simulations encourage students to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.\r\n"
"The fact that they have to think themselves, they measure difference and have to think about explanations and test if what they think is also right. They go much deeper into problems."
"The different simulations where every student can visualize hard to understand topics is for me the most effective aspect of the WISE platform. Sometime teachers don't have a lot of visual support and this a brilliant support for the hard to understand topic offered in a curriculum. By having a visual perspective of a topic, students can reflect on various scenarios and they can create new ideas. WISE gives the opportunity for students to really use their critical thinking and inquiry skills and that's for me the most effective aspect of the platform."
"Teaching about certain topic is easy , but making sure how many students understood and their concepts are clear , WISE helped the teacher to know what is the level of understanding and the students get to figure out on their own and by experimenting . The pictures and the information were interesting , it makes a child get into the topic and test things on their own ."
"In my opinion the most effective aspects of the WISE activity are the ability to compare simulation and the ability to test predictions. With this two activity students can, on the best possible way, learn and apply learned lessons."
"There were many aspects of the WISE activity on thermodynamics that I suspect were very effective in helping students learn the topics.  One aspect was providing students with animations that show what heat is doing at the molecular level.  This can be hard for students to visualize and impossible to show in demonstrations, for students cannot see what the molecules are doing and how they are reacting.  However, through the WISE activity, they are able to do so.  It also provided students to do some investigations that might not have been feasible to do as real labs, whether due to lack of materials or inability to manipulate the heat as needed.  More generally, it was great how WISE allowed students investigate the answers to key questions, rather than simply listening to a lecture were answers or provided or reading a textbook and looking at diagrams.  This interactive, kinesthetic way of learning can be very beneficial for many students.  Lastly, it was interesting that teachers were able to modify these lessons and share them with colleagues.  This collaboration can help teachers to provide the best possible instruction based on the needs of their students."
"As the teacher said, the possibility of breaking the concepts into smaller pieces makes it easier for the students to comprehend a complex understanding such as Thermodynamics. I also think that getting out of the traditional and boring model of reading books through the use of a new platform is much more attractive for the students. They must feel much more independent and engaged in learning using WISE."
"Some aspect: if we want technology to play a meaningful role in student learning\r\nthen teachers need to be experimenting, and reflecting and they need support from the school.\r\n"
"They were exposed to different tools like simulations, were able to collect their reflections and measurements, a way to engage them and help them break down concepts, making it easier to understand the lesson."
"- simulation of different materials in the transfer of heat \r\n- predicting/testing predictions\r\n- challenge to investigate and measure and think of possible answers\r\n- WISE tracks student understanding, allows teacher to provide prompt feedback\r\n"
Wise seems to be very effective on engaging students to learn autonomously. 
"The whole approach by the makers of WISE is fantastic and insightful. By allowing tremendous flexibility and customising of lessons and topics for teachers, as well as the breakdown of ideas and then scafolding to support better understanding for students, is the very essence of a well developed educational technology (in this case web-based software to support science education).  As a high school Technology teacher, my efforts have been focussed on guiding my students to (and through) the knowledge, skills and motivation they need, then facilitating their learning as they apply these to solving problems and challenges.  The WISE program provides most of this same kind of appraoch and at a student's own pace.  The teacher becomes guide, facilitator and coach when using this kind of excellent teaching tool."
- teacher can modify to match background from class\r\n- breaks concepts down\r\n- inquiry based
I think the visual aspects nicely reinforce the concepts being taught.  I also thought the modification tool is very useful in a diverse classroom where you want inclusive learning.
The feature of the activity thatt divides the topic is divided in small units for the students to build on them a coherent understanding
small activities that allowed students to test their assumptions/predictions of a phenomena
"I absolutely loved the way the students could interact with the lesson.  This is not one dimensional fact giving, this was hands on learning that students obviously gained a better understanding of the thermodynamic concept from.  I also think that Jennifer was about to adapt the WISE platform to suit her classroom needs is very effective."
"I believe that is the simulations, divide the learning in small concepts and the opportunity of the teacher accompany the students learning."
"I loved the simulations and student-centered approach. Students were able to learn at their own pace, and the teacher could have conversations with small groups instead of lecturing a class. Individual progress on WISE and feedback from groups gave the teacher an idea of where the students were at in terms of understanding."
"In my opinion, the most effective aspects were the scaffolding of the content, the visual presentation, the quality of the instructions and the formative data the teacher could gather about each student progress."
"Animations, possibility of adjusting lessons according to students needs, assess learning  and interaction among teh students"
"The use of simple simulation to present a topic and its investigative nature make WISE project very engaging for the student. The easy access of their reflections, predictions and explanation are the as well most important to the teacher."
most effective visuals of experiments and helps in a simple way of understanding topics.
"The WISE activity allowed students to learned about the topics through a hands-on approach. This seemed effective for a few different reasons. First, the students were required to make predictions before they began the experiment. This allowed the students to start to think of their own ideas about thermodynamics. This is also a great way for the teacher to see the students' prior knowledge. Secondly, the activity was broken down into multiple parts, which encouraged the students to stay on task. Finally, the students were able to perform all of the parts of the activity on their own. This is vital in encouraging students to become involved in the learning process. "
I really liked how it was self-paced.  And I noticed students working on computers together so I am thinking there is also the opportunity for students to discuss/collaborate on their reflections and predictions.
"Some of the aspects that I saw were more effective are the visulas and animations, the activity where they actually have to go and touch the different objects.  This activity filled the need of the visual and kinesthesic students.  The interactive platform in which the teacher can access to the students work and check what they were doing really help her address studentsÎ misconceptions.  "
" The sttudents learning doing tasks in real , so this plataform is good because they can do both, im just worried about a lot information at the same time , i believe is interesting do discusssions about teory first ,and after came to practic and finally go to the wise., but the possibilty to share experience is  fantastic to students and teachers."
"in my opinion, WISE is an excellent education tool in many different ways:\r\n1) Organization: It helps students and teachers to keep track where they are and how they are doing throughout the in Inquiry. It has a very effective tool called Evidence basket that lets students collect their own data trough the class, and make it visible or not to colleagues. Through this, the teacher can understand how the process of thinking and knowledge building are coming together.\r\n2) Conceptual work: As it states, the conceptual work on the WISE is clearly effective since it breaks a big complex concept into small pieces that can be argued and problematized in different perspectives. This process is made by encouraging gathering and building data trough both theory and observation.\r\n3) Group Work: The tool helps the learners to work individually in certain tasks and collectively in others, promoting argument."
The visuals that were provided can be effective in teaching topics that are abstract.  It appeared as though the students the students were actually collecting data that they were then able to use to synthesize ideas.
Having students make predictions and then test them; simulations help visual learners understand complex concepts.
"the students could visualize a difficult concept. Various models, videos and demonstrations helped them grasp the concept of heat. \r\nThe topic was broken down into smaller units so it was easier for the students to understand  it. \r\nThe students work at their own pace, they have time to reflect on the new material. at the same time they worked with their classmates who could offer support whenever they didn't  understand  something."
The breaking up of the activity into small parts and enabling the students to earn from the small parts to understand the bigger picture as a whole. There was simulation as well which garnered students interest.
"Aspects of WISE activity which seem to be most worthy are:\r\n1. Instructors do not give direct answer to the students rather they believe in diverting the students toward self-analyzing and self-learning concept\r\n2. Curiosity and excitement of the students increases\r\n3. Students are motivated towards analyzing the concept, thinking on it, exact interpretation, and development of actual understanding.\r\n4. Involvement and engagement of the students seem to be highly increased as they enjoy what they have been doing\r\n5. Rather than visualizing the concepts in the mind, it is always better to understand the things through simulations and physical touch which is achieved through this WISE activity"
"The way WISE used simulations and broke down concepts into smaller parts that then build on each other to create a better understanding. Also, encouraging the students to ask questions, collaborate and investigate topics to find solutions."
The activity which included the visual display of heat conduction or convection was really a nice exercise to upgrade students way of thinking and enable them to think creatively. Also the way of online examination really helps students to take part more interactively.
"the ability for students to go back and review a item of information, if they don't get it the first time, or things get a bit confusing."
"It was interactive, they were able to visualize rather than just rote. The students developed their understanding after the WISE interactive sessions."
"The activities which is breaks down the concepts into pieces that helps students to reflect, make predictions and use stimulation where the learners will investigate, measure and think. "
It allows the teacher to access all of their ideas using the assessment tool. \r\nit can analyse and sort ideas for discussion\r\nit tracks the developmental stages of students' learning\r\nit helps gives and receives feedback\r\nit helps differentiating and group work  \r\n\r\ncollaborate with partners collaborate with partners
"I think that is was very important that students have been able to test their predictions. Moreover  they had the opportunity to work together with their schoolmates and use simulations in order to make comparisons. Furthermore the reflection on various scenarios gave them the opportunity to explore, test, learn through their mistakes, investigate and think. Students are part of the lesson and in cooperation with the education can redesign their lesson so that they can better understand the concepts taught."
"WISE provides various scenarios for learning. It allow student to collaborate with partners, and to make and test their predictions by computer simulation."
"I think that the most effective tools that the WISE activity provide are the visuals and the reflections at the begining and at the end. First of all, using the visuals they could build a more significative knowledge about the topic, because they will join the theoric learning with a picture. Secondly, the reflection made by students is very useful, due to the fact that themselves could see how their learning are increasing. Moreover, they will reflect about their ideas at the begining and why they think that, identifying the incorrect subjects. "
"I am particularly intrigued with the WISE activity especially the aspect that encouraged the students to take responsibilities for their knowledge, here, they are able to question and investigate every knowledge they come across and not just absorb everything hook, line and sinker."
"Helping the students with visuals that assisted them in understanding the topic, using their own surroundings to assist in this learning bringing it off the screen into their own environment. "
The simulation based lessons are most effective. I believe that only when one experiences a scenario or a problem will one be able to make an effective decision. 
"I haven't personally been exposed to the WISE platform yet. From the video, one of the most helpful things I thought, was the ability to reflect, while following the scientific method (predict/observe/explain). Jennifer spoke of the fact that this concept is more abstract (and therefore, more difficult to understand) as it deals with small particles and she really liked the simulations. I would like to engage with the platform myself to decide whether it is the reflection, the simulations, the structure of the learning, or some combination of these things (and more) that result in benefits to the students and their learning."
One of the hallmarks that the system WISE provide for learners while learning big challenging concepts in science is can be broken into small pieces of sub ideas that learners will discover over the course to understand big issues in science (using implicitly Inductive Reasoning) like what we saw in the video of Jennifer class teaching thermodynamic.
"breaking up a concept in smaller pieces; let them explore, meassure, ask critical questions, simulate, discuss et cetera and build up the concept in a comprehensive way. \r\nStart, do and learn...."
Jennifer mentioned that this WISE activity combined simulations with concrete learning to provide students opportunities to construct the theoretical - much like how our Ontario math curriculum moves students from exploring with concrete materials to developing a broad conceptual understanding. 
"Firstly, the students are seperated into several groups to use wise, which is good for them to exchange their ideas. Secondly, the students could do the investigation themselves to check whether their method is right, which help them to be creative. Third, using wise makes the students abtain different ideas about some questions. They present the ideas and discuss them.\r\n"
"It gives students a chance to learn by doing. Often, students tune in and out of a lesson, even if they are interested. By putting the work in their hands, they have to be engaged in order to get the result. A program like WISE puts the student in the driver seat, which empowers them to seek to learn on their own. "
"The students were able to visualize, experiment,demonstrate and explore which is best method for the present generation.\r\n"
The hands on experiences gives them the learning at their pace. I like that the unit was run at their own pace. 
I think the use of fragments to simplify the knowledge and getting involved in group discussions
"It seems like the WISE activity is an effective way to streamline and organize components of a lesson so that work can be done in 'real time'- if this lesson was done without this kind of technology, I imagine, the ability to track progress and review students' understanding in order to adjust and offer scaffolding would be delayed by the teacher's inability to collect materials and grade them over time. It seems like the WISE platform gives her instant access to student responses and that students benefit from the familiarity of responding to prompts on their computers. \r\n\r\nThis WISE activity provides differentiation, especially in collaborative groups. Students who are more 'hands on' can take the lead in the testing phase of the module, while students who like responding to text can do that portion. Students who are understanding can help 'teach what they get' by hypothesizing within their group.\r\n\r\nThe teacher  also had the freedom to move around the classroom while the student driven simulations were taking place and because of this she could get a better overview of progress and understanding, without needing to lecture or actively 'teach' in front of the classroom. \r\n\r\nThese kinds of interactive days always are so effective because students tend to 'remember' so much more when they are active while they are learning. \r\n"
"Firstly, the students are seperated into several groups to use wise, which is good for them to exchange their ideas. Secondly, the students could do the investigation themselves to check whether their method is right, which help them to be creative. Third, using wise makes the students abtain different ideas about some questions. They present the ideas and discuss them. "
"It allows to break the key ideas to smaller, manageable parts. It engages the students to activities..."
"I love that teachers can modify the WISE lesson to make it more relevant to information they have already taught. The computer program collects student answers, which provides an amazing assessment FOR learning opportunity, as the teacher can view all student responses and flag interesting ones for class discussion on the projector."
The interactive nature of the WISE program makes teaching and learning and acquisition of new concepts very effective.
The simulation seemed to be very effective as she said the demos where fun but the take away and what the students remembered was less then when they ran the simulations on the wise.  The planning of the lesson she commented was overwhelming at the start but it became very useful for her to make adjustments and modifications before the lesson is delivered.  
The teacher can see what the students have been working on and responding to. This allows the teacher to question any errors or new ideas so that the student has to explain their thinking to a further depth. The students can help each other out to solve any questions. Information may be repeated without problems.
"The exploratory approach and personal nature of the activity were both very effective. Having students interact with a wide range of materials in their classroom that they encounter everyday but encouraging them to think about them differently was sure to stick much longer than content taught in a more traditional sense. Providing 2 back-to-back classes allowed student teams to engage more fully with the topic and explore more in depth, and the immediate formative feedback provided allowed the teacher to interact with students more effectively to move the lesson along.  "
"Wise has educative recourse, create and edit documents and share with your partnes. \r\n"
"I think the idea of split the topic in small concepts for the students to understand better is great, besides is manageable and students engaged rapidly on it   "
The visual aids seemed to really assist the students in actually seeing what was going on in the experiments.
"I've never used the WISE platform, but from what I could see from Jennifer's presentation, it seemed that the program was interactive, and it scaffolded learning for the students.  It also seemed that the students were very engaged, and it asked for reflective answers from them to really get them thinking about the topic."
Having them make predictions and reflecting on the material is very important and effective. I think demo are important. However a demo without talk and reflection is just a show and may not help the students to adjust their thinking and update their understanding.
The way students could modify information themselves and relate directly to the data. The simulations were also helpful in giving students many different scenarios to work with.
The fact that the students were actively engaged in the learning activities. They were provided with guidance  but given the freedom to discover on their own  \r\n\r\n
Small scale simulations then free response questions to show student thought processes.
"Using technology\r\nHaving different situations that students could see what happens with heat and different materials\r\nBeing able to develop predictions and test them out\r\nMore than just a lecture, hands on to better help the learners\r\nCollaborate with peers \r\nInvestigate and ask questions that lead to more investigation "
"Monitoring of the learning process, not just the final results.\r\nMediation: x student teacher through the platform.\r\nMonitoring of the learning process, individually or in small groups of students.\r\nAdaption of activities in accordance with the profile of the class platform."
I thought that the WISE activity was a brilliant way to review what the students have learned about Thermodynamics. The simulations really helped the students visualize the effects of heat. 
"The animated visual were very effective, but I saw that the student still wanted to try it out themselves, feel tand experience the heat and verify what the lesson visuals showed them."
The fact that it can be self paced - I like that students can work at their own pace - I think they can take more in on this. I also liked that you can see their ideas and learn more about your students.
"i think students learn most from interaction and trying themselves. So I think it was the simulators where students tried different materials with the pictures of the finger transmitting heat, this involves both visual illustration following student interaction where the illustration explains why the answer was right or wrong, or when the student tries different materials and he sees the results and the different in results on the spot. this will remain in the memory of the student and won't need to study it... It is already a well-understood concept now."
Discussion of issues together in order to expos ideas and concepts to be adopted new tools and teaching methodologies
"The hands-on exercises that linked the theoretical with students' own life experiences seemed especially helpful to me, as well as the opportunity for the teacher to interact with smaller groups of students to reach them at their point of need."
"The way all students were involved, no one was left aside.  They all followed the suggested activities, tried, tested and experienced the concept of heat.  It was friendly as they all worked with their laptops and it was fun. Students created the class.  "
"1. At 4:35 mark in the video, I am realizing that students, in a way, have their own personalized teacher assistance as in the form of laptop. This is quite striking and significant for me; the problems I've encountered with seating plans can be solved by implementing laptop/WISE based lectures and lesson plans.\r\n\r\n2. As a supplementary tool, WISE is extremely helpful for students to review/pre-view their lectures at anywhere and at anytime. This may allow deeper understanding of the learnt/planned topics. In addition, WISE program covers visual, auditory (unsure) aspects of learning. It aids students to visualize some of the difficult topics, and all nicely organized and divided into sections and sub-sections.\r\n\r\n3. WISE may save time. Although there are some troubling aspects that I can foresee, students might not have to organize an off-line group meeting just to engage and complete a group activity. Students do not need to carry books, encyclopedias, other textbooks, learning utensils to on-line meetings.\r\n\r\n4. WISE may allow more participation. A lot of students have trouble speaking out to response and answer in real-time. \r\n\r\n5. Students can make predictions, using the program and test out their predictions in class. This might save a lot of class time and reinforce students' interest. \r\n\r\n6. The teacher can have a quick access to the ideas of all of the participating students. This is quite difficult to do in a traditional classroom with a multiple number of students.\r\n\r\n7. The teacher and students have more time now in class to discuss and engage in focused discussions. This is because WISE keeps track of students' reflections and marks.\r\n\r\n8. The teacher has to input more time and effort when implementing WISE activity in his/her curriculum. This will allow the teacher to perfect her lessons. \r\n\r\n9. Saves environment. No more printing and photocopying."
"In my opinion, there are some aspects that were most effective, such as, the exchanging of meaning between student-student.  And using the new topic in real situation (Thermodynamics in the kitchen)\r\nWhen the students share what they know with their peer and listen to their peers, the learning process is successful, because when they express their ideas, they can clarify some dues and build their own concepts together. \r\nAlso, is so important that students can put in practice what they are learning, because when an individual does an action, he could remember that action. Experimentation is very critical because it offer the opportunity of use the knowledge in the real life; and it is the main goal of the learning process. \r\n"
"Simulations that allow students to collaborate and investigate topics seem to help students place concepts in a real world context. I loved that they were using the technology, but also getting up and moving around the classroom, using things that were already there. The lesson utilized the technology, but was so much more than just the one technology tool."
I thin that having them questioning things at first and then to predict something to cofirm it by themselves is very effective because they feel involved in the topic and the actually want to know what happens because now it's interesting for them. \r\n
"Technology was a precise strategy through WISE software which served to ilustrate to students the termodynamics lesson, this mean of learning was very interactive. then another strategy was collaborative learning, because teacher organize her class in both small and multiple student groups. so that they can learn topics about heat."
giving them some practical examples in day to day life.
"Customized questions, interactive visuals, and chunking were some benefits of the WISE activity."
"I think using WISE activity, children are able to understand the concepts thoroughly especially in areas where only verbal explanations are possible. The areas where they can't see the process happening even during an experiment."
"WISE helps students to hypothesis and make predictions for starting a lesson. And in this way students are inspired to look forward to knowing theories. So when it comes  to real experiment, they are more motivated than before and engaged."
It broke the lesson down into manageable chucks that the students could digest prior to moving to the next. It also provided a launching pad from which discussions could occur.
"The main point I found useful is the possibility to divide the topic into smaller concepts in order to recollect their own knowledge and the new concepts so in the end they are capable of building up their own conception and compare it to the one proposed by the  teacher so the latter can realise whether they have achieved their goals.\r\nStudents tend to get caught up into dense topics and sometimes cannot find their way out of them but going back to beginning and skipping the lesson. In my own experience as a kid, I recall having trouble with math and doing so. Nowadays, I realise young adults and late teenagers still do such thing. Perhaps, the trick is to keep students find an easy way to relate real world to theory along with coach's guidance."
"- Breaking the topic down into small, manageable pieces\r\n- providing simulations that were concrete and within the students' realm of experience (e.g. The hot iron heating different surfaces to melt chocolate chips)\r\n- providing a classroom / real world opportunity to physically engage in topic material (e.g. Touching classroom objects & checking their temperatures)"
The way it broke down the concepts into small chunks and scaffolded the students' learning.
"Thanks for opening my eyes for the WISE activity.  I just join and had no experience in it.\r\nI guess the idea of breaking down chunks of concepts into small, manageable sizes for students' experimentation; plus the provision of feedback after each small section maintain their interest and make them inquisitive."
"An aspect of the WISE activity that I thought was effective in  terms of helping students learn the topics was that the students were encouraged to investigate, measure and think about the possible explanations."
"I thought that it was great that the students could perform virtual experiments using WISE and see the results instantaneously. This way time was saved in the classroom from performing many of the experiments and waiting for results. Students could easily picture and predict what would happen in real life by going through the activities in WISE. Furthermore, the assessment tools in WISE were more student friendly and quicker for students to make observations and come to conclusions and instantly submit it to the teacher who was thereby able to evaluate student responses faster too. "
watching experiments and doing things for themselves helped the students understand the concept better.
"I think the variety of demonstrations were important for the students. They could also explore the demonstrations at their own pace, if they wanted to watch a demonstration again they could and when they were ready to move on to another section they did. The WISE activity allowed them to work in small groups so they could discuss their learning with peers and they went through. Lastly it gave them an opportunity to reflect  and interact with the learning topic."
"Students were provided with the scope to observe, touch some items in the classroom and thoroughly investigate the information they were receiving.They were exposed to making predictions about their lesson outcomes and they were involved in not only the theoretical aspect of the lesson but the practical aspect as well."
"Well, the most effective aspect of the WISE activity is to engage students in certain kinds of creative activities so that\r\nthey can build ideas autonomously, interact with peers,\r\nand provide their teacher with insights to support formative assessment\r\nand differentiated instruction. "
"The WISE activity simplified abstract ideas, making them more accessible to young learners."
It can visualize some processes that are not easy to understand.  It is interactive and allow students to learn with fun.
Aspects that were most effective for student learning were the visuals and simulations.  They were real life examples and ones that the students themselves could experiment with as the lesson progressed.  The video showed the joy in the students faces as they learned.  
Investigation and research as well discussions about what they found. WISE is a good tool for these purposes. Students are engaged in learning when they can use new technologies in the classroom.
"I think the interaction and simulations are great to help students learn the topic.  I also like the reflection/questioning portion, really getting students to think about what they have learned and talk about it in their own words.  As a teacher, being able to see student responses immediately means you can stop them and give them more support right in the moment, if necessary, before they go too far off track."
The visuals and the simulations. I liked that  the teacher could modify the structure to her own needs and that the students could collaborate with each other. Also great  that the  students did some real-life in conjunction with WISE like touching real objects in class
The explanation of concept of heat transfer via simulations was most effective in my view because students were able to grab the concepts by visualizing what they were not able to see physically.
In WISE activity students learn using simulations in a collaborative environment. The WISE platform is a way to make predictions and to verify hypothesis in collaboration with peers and teacher. 
"Students can learn at their own pace or level of rigor, teacher is flexible to meet with students one-on-one for extra support"
"Test response, please ignore.\r\nTest response, please ignore.\r\nTest response, please ignore."
When students used simulations  and reflections to interact with the topics. 
"The visuals included in these lessons would be very beneficial to a variety of learners.  I enjoyed the fact that this program allows teachers to see a lesson /assessment and modify it to suit our needs.  So in essence, we have a starting point and don't have to always reinvent the wheel.  Because really, we don't have time for that. "
Help in terms of visualizations that provide a better explanation of some complicated terms and processes.
Aspects of the WISE activities on heat that stood tall are:\r\nThe use of simple simulation to enable learners discover or confirm their prior knowledge. \r\nThe brake down of concepts to enable learners construct the knowledge for themselves. \r\nThe use of questions to query learning and record of learner's progress. \r\nThe flexibility of the project or programme.
I really liked that it had built-in simulations and questions that helped prompt students to reflect and collect their data and thoughts.
"As I understand it the activity is customizable. I think this is extremely helpful since different teachers and different classes will inevitably have somewhat different objectives, abilities and interests."
Experience before concepts - learning with the real world. \r\nCollaborayive learning approach.\r\nClassroom environment more close to group activity.
I believe that an effective aspect was the simulations that helped the students to see in real time what happens. The ability of students to search for information and do several experiments at home is another effective aspect.
The mist effective parts of the WISE activity include having multiple examples and providing a different way to explain the same concept so more students might grasp the concept. 
"I like the idea that the activity could be differentiated. In my class my students have different learning styles and learning levels, which can make designing a lesson difficult. I also liked the ideas that the teacher could run or preview the lesson first."
One of the aspects was that the students go to visually see on the computer/tablet how heat transfer works. Another aspects was that the teacher was able to stop the program to address any confusion as the lesson went along. One more aspects was allowing the students to touch the objects for themselves to get a sensory element to the lesson.
"Wise activity helps students to reflect on various scenarios , collaborate with their peers and to make and test their predictions.Adding that it helps students to break down concepts into very small manageable pieces  to be understood easily ."
"WISE is very visually pleasant to students, people intuitively love the things which possess colors and motions, WISE provides that. And it also incorporate elements like testing students' understanding and giving them feedback instantly, which gives students sense of connection which conventional techniques can't provide."
"Students were all actively engaged with the work. There was a range of activities that included simulations and practical activities but most importantly, the concepts that underpin heat transfer were developed so learners made the connection between the practical aspects and the theory."
"WISE could help students in understanding their lessons as was mentioned before in demonstrating videos it breaks concept, it can provide students with the knowledge and information they need in an easy way, as in video it was difficult on students to understand heat concept and how its transmitted in which heat is like an imaginary thing as it mainly depend on particles which is difficult to be understood, however on using demonstration videos,diagrams,and photos through WISE  it facilitate the way of providing the information from teacher to the students, on the other hand teachers can easily edit information, knowledge that could be delivered for the students, also WISE can help teachers to focus on weak points and flag these points to be easily avoided on next subjects, also WISE is an accessible program for students on laptop,personal computers at any where and at any time which save time for both teachers and students.

- allowing students to come up with conjectures that they can test\r\n- freeing up the teacher to visit with small groups and address specific questions\r\n- allowing teacher to identify widespread confusion and address it\r\n- allowing teacher to summarize/synthesize the class' ideas and present them.\r\n- timely feedback to students
"In my opinion the most effective aspects of the WISE activity are: \r\n- the possibility to use simulations \r\n- predicting possible reactions  \r\n- experiencing how different materials feel by touching them. \r\nIt gives the students a chance to investigate, measure and think of likely expectations. \r\nI also like the technology used, as it gave the teacher the possibility to access students' ideas, choose some of them and then project them for further discussion.        "
The modifications in lesson plans according to the batch of the year. It also provides a wide range of activity based learning to students.
-simulations help students visualize the scientific concepts and understand them better.\r\n-students can learn at individual pace and the way they feel comfortable.\r\n-teacher can have control  at the same time address students in need.\r\n-assessing the students and reflecting on them is also beneficial.\r\n
Every student was engaged in activity helping each other. It makes easy to understand.
The WISE activity broke the material into manageable chunks of information.  It also provided the teacher with evidence of the students' understanding of the topic at hand.  The simulations provided improved visuals for better understanding.
It keep the students on track.  Provide opportunity for measuring and collecting data.  In addition students could reflect and record reflection.  The software acted as a scaffold to learning
"According to the video, WISE chunks the knowledge into small units, demonstrate certain abstract knowledge with a vivid visual animations, build a platform where students can exchange their ideas and receive feedback efficiently, and allow teachers to monitor students' learning process and provide guidelines in time. "
The collaborative action that Wise helps students in learning and digital simulations of the thermal processes.
"The WISE activity works as a scaffold to students learning. The students have the opportunity investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations. In this project students are guided by a web-based system to reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners and to make and test their predictions. The WISE lesson let the students develop a deeper understanding of the topic."
The students will feel and learn that topic. So they never forgot that topic.
"the most effective activity is the simulations and real life environment inside the program. also, the feedback that is directly given by the teacher, and the teacher's immediate monitoring of the learning process. "
"One aspect that I think helped students learn was that this platform allows student to collaborate while learning. There's also the benefit of breaking up the topic into easy-to-understand parts so each student at the end can understand the whole concept. \r\n\r\nI can also say that this website helps teachers to easily track students' progress and as a result the teacher is capable of identifying  in real time which student or group of students need more guidance. In turn, students learn more effectively."
A platform that the student and teacher can interact through which is flexible enough to allow modifications. The ability to use prepared ;lessons and modify to suit the class has benefit. The activities being used seem to engage the students at a higher level  and the simulations used will help student understanding.  The ability to monitor student progress is also useful
The sped up digital lab provide nice visuals of heat transfer.
"reflection, collaboration, make and test their predictions, simulation and investigate, measure and think."
"The aspects that I think were most effective are: that everyone could have access to the information, that some animations and drawings were displayed, that it was divided by sections, that the teacher could modify the information and the exercises if she considered necessary, that you can monitor the progress and assess the students. "
It is interactive and interesting. It helps to learn new topics.
"First of all, it is an important assessment tool for the teacher learn from the students about what they are thinking and how they are responding to the topics. Secondly, it encourages them to investigate. And also it is easy to bring up an exemple on the projector for a discussion and share it with the colleagues."
Student surfed through the knowledge and they could experience all the concepts. At the same time it's especially important the possibility of predict and verify. 
The visuals\r\nThe chance to physically interact with the materials to confirm the theory\r\nThe simulations 
"In fact, the web-based system can foster students collaboration and help them to reflect on various aspects of the topic. Simulation is another advantage  of the tool. The tool helps student to be more productive and creative. They can make and test their predictions. Students are no longer passive consumers of technology. They are active participants who are able to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations. Besides, the platform can be used for discussion and assessment. \r\n"
The ability to let the students see the topic from more than one angle!
WISE activity constitutes a helpful tool to promote inquiry learning in foreing language education and is considered to effective and efficient in helping students learn a variety of topics.
The ability to work the theme of the class into smaller topics associated with the simulations.
"The wise system helped the students to test  the information by themselves and test it in the real life and this will help the student to understand the information in better way and stay in his mind than the traditional way of learning .Also the wise system encouraged the students to investigate ,measure and think about the possible explanations of the information."
"I identified a number of benefits: The students were given the opportunity for effective learning to take place as they  reflected on scenarios, collaborated with others, constructed and evaluated predictions, engaged in simulations that helped to further develop their schema on the topic. In addition, the learners had the opportunity to investigate, measure, and explain. I believe that the opportunities provided by the WISE platform helped to reinforce student learning at different levels. "
"I love that in this program as the program collects their reflections it can scaffold their learning.  Asking questions to reinforce the concept.  Also, the interactive component is very effective.  Having students read about thermodynamics and then use a hands on activity."
"The WISE activity was effective in helping students learn a topic by encouraging students to investigate and test their ideas as they developed an understanding of the concepts of thermodynamics.  Students were excited to to search for the knowledge and communicate their understanding with peers.  The posed questions, simulations and diagrams helped students develop deeper understanding of the concept beyond recitation of definitions."
"giving students simulations and more examples on conduction, convection, and radiation."
1.simulations for students to have better understanding of the topic.\r\n2. students could make a predictions and test their predictions.\r\n3. students work in the small groups which allow them to collaborate with each other.\r\n
"First of all, the fact that students were helping each other, like Prof. Ram_n Ferreiro from NOVA Southeastern University said this past weekend at #InterESTRATIC: The best teacher for a kid is another kid.\r\nSecondly, the students were actually researching, experimenting, conjecturing, testing... the whole 'Scientific Method' hands on. It doesn't get better than that, does it?"
simulations which gives a feeling of hands on experience to the students. they feel that they found out the facts by their own.
1.  They felt the objects by themselves\r\n2.   They melted chocolate bars on hot iron and glass\r\n3.   They got to know why heat transported more quickly through some more than others
The WISE activity slows down the learning by scaffolding individual students learning as well as providing visuals which can be another way of reteaching previously taught material. It allows students to collaborate and building on each others knowledge because the teacher is able to see where students may be getting stuck and push their thinking along by sharing the thinking of other students or ask probing questions which may help them see the material differently.
"WISE aspects like simulation, breaking concepts into small manageable pieces and freedom of modification according to learner need were most effective and lastly I loved the aspect of learner track record."
To be able to see in a video how physics work I thing It's very important to the students and of course the importance that they could repeat the lessons or instructions the times they required it's very important.
The most interesting aspect is the possibilit to build a set of activity that we can inquery our students to develop their capabilities.
"The direct contact with each concept, the opportunity for each student to experiment with each concept, the possibility to share ideas with the teacher and receive instant feedback."
"Students make predictions\r\nStudents test their predictions\r\nStudents were not given an answer\r\nStudents investigate,measure and think possible answer based on their results\r\nStudents carry out simulations and can thus refine their answer"
the reflection aspect is the most effective in terms of helping students learn the topics as well as the opportunity to experiment
"WISE IS EFFECTIVE IN TEACHING SCIENCE,AND GIVES STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN NEW ASPECTS OF THE SUBJECT."
"It allowed students to learn how to learn, which was excellent for them because it promoted life long learning which is vitally important for student success in school and the workplace. "
"That it breaks down the subject so that the students can understand. They can see simulations that can help them understand better. And it makes them active agents in their own learning process, they are investigating, thinking and reflecting about the topic."
Definitely the most important aspect is the one that showed them through graphics and demonstrations how heat was conducted. 
Wise makes easy student collecting their reflections. Student would have a better understanding through self experience and this platform provide a good scenery for that purpose.
"I liked how WISE was interactive for the students and provided images that enabled them to understand concepts. It also allowed teachers to assess student learning and provide timely feedback on their learning. Not only did it provide hands-on learning, but it was engaging for the students and targeted their point of need."
I thought that finding the time to work on a confusing or difficult aspect with WISE to be useful in my teaching of a foreign language because more ways and angles eventually help them find answers to their questions without embarrassment. The other is having more control and being able to share my results. The final thing that I like about WISE is that changes and editing are made possible to work for any type of course. 
The opportunity for the teacher to observe student understanding and where further clarification might be needed or explained in a different way.
"The combination of breaking down the information into small, manageable pieces and then providing visuals using that information.This way, the students learn about the building blocks of the full topic individually, and as they get this piecemeal foundation, they are able to stack up the knowledge into understanding the broader topic."
The access to material on the web is very challenging as there are number of resources on one topic. This helps the child to pick up the resource based on her/his understanding. This is also an indicator for the teacher whether the instructions were followed by the students or not. 
"Students will visual concepts, inmediatly interactions with peers and the teachers, and be able to record the process and outcomes that they experienced. "
"The activity was based on previous lessons and trial software.It was used to reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners and make and test their own predictions. The idea of being able to simulate the wise and do it collaboratively are aspects that I think is most relevant."
"Activation of students, the activity provoke them to think about problems, formulate their ideas and share them with classmates."
"Students can work in a collaborative way, they can testing their predictions and understand concepts in a different way based in the experimentation."
Students become more familiar with recording information as a collective which allows for questioning how someone comes up with an answer resulting in explaining concepts using a language that is sourced from an individual who has a similar persepective/knowledge base to whom it could be easier to relate to.\r\n
"1- Memory as a Problem-Solving Tool\r\n2- concentration is exclusive attention to one object and to concentrate is to bring all efforts, faculties,\r\n3-Active Reading and Listening\r\n4-Exam Preparation and Performance\r\n5- Using Your Time Effectively"
The students meet the different materials\r\nThey reflect on the measurements they have to experiment
The WISE activity allowed students to make and test predictions with regard to the topic.  It helped them understand the concept.
The fact that the student self directs and can return and review material.
"I liked how the WISE activity really broke the overall concept into small, manageable steps that slowly built the student's understanding of each sub-section of the overall concept, gradually leading students to a full understanding of the main topic.  This type of scaffolding allows stronger students to quickly consolidate their knowledge and build to their new understanding about the topic and allows students in need of more support, to use the stepping stones of the WISE program, to give them the essential understanding that they need.  For example, a teacher trying to do such an activity without the support of WISE, would not necessarily know how long to remain on any one aspect of the activity, and may move too quickly for some students and too slowly for others.  By using technology, the student drives the speed of learning and is able to adjust that to fit their personal processing speed (within the two 80 min periods given for the activity)."
I think the ability to test their own ideas and hold experiments helps students really understand difficult concepts. They can then share their findings with their peers.  I think the visual aspect also helps with understanding.
"I really liked that the WISE activity allowed the students to explore the concepts of Thermodynamics through an investigation where they had the opportunity to somewhat control the order of the investigation and come to their own conclusions and understanding of the concepts based on their experience.\r\n\r\nIt provided the students with the opportunity to easily restart and redo the investigation numerous times, thereby building confidence in themselves and not having to worry about dong something wrong.\r\n\r\nIt was great the their teacher could monitor their progress throughout the activity and step in and intervene and even get the whole class to pause. Especially, when she noticed that there was a misconception about the concept or that they were coming to an incorrect conclusion based on the data. It is hard to do that during an actual live lab.  "
It is a very interactive platform to communicate between teachers and students
"Students were allowed to work at their own pace, which created a great source of differentiation. The lesson was broken down into smaller subtopics with questions and visuals for each subtopic that students could interact with. Each subtopic progressed so that connections were made to previous material and laid the foundation for the next section. Students were required to submit justifications along with their answers, so they can't just skip through it by picking random answers. Overall, the students were engaged, and that is always one of the biggest factors in effective student learning."
The simulations and visuals. The ability to break down concepts into small digestible pieces.
"As I am an ESL (English as a Foreign Language) teacher, I'd focus on very simple science processes to learn in collaboration with the science teacher. Therefore, we would be working on cross-curricular activities. Students, in this sense, would experiment with already acquired knowledge in the subject, so that it is easier for them to interact in English during the WISE activity. \r\n\r\nI believe it would be very effective, as these are the kind of activities which motivate students to communicate with each other in a meaningful way."
It allowed students to reflect on various situations. Investigate measure and think if what they predicted was true or not.
"Interactivity, collaboration and social interactions during the class. The way that the topic was broken into small chunks and then put back together to give students the chance to understand it from multiple perspectives. The opportunity that it gave for students to learn and then reflect upon that learning."
"I thought the WISE lesson on Thermodynamics was effective because...\r\n- it allows for different simulations\r\n- it develops deeper understanding of concepts\r\n- it breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and helps the students scaffold them to build those ideas up to a better understanding.\r\n- it has great visuals and allows students to work individually or with their peers."
" tell the kids the right answer,\r\nbut rather they encourage them to investigate, measure, and think\r\nabout the possible explanations.\r\nWISE activity breaks down concepts\r\ninto very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students,\r\nscaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up\r\nto a more coherent understanding.\r\n"
"Self-paced yet highly structured, with opportunity for the teacher to customize the activity to their individual students."
"I consider that the most important aspect that we must recognize in order to students can be involve with the topic is that they can make predictions; it allows that they can understand and explore the topic much better. Further, students can explain their own points of view and they can discuss their ideas with their classmates and teachers not only in class but also in the real life. "
"I found WISE to be a very interactive system that is a well-balanced blend between online and in-class learning. Students were able to reflect, collaborate and make comparisons as well as encourages rich discussions as it does not immediately provide the answer.  It broke down the concept of heat into smaller portions so they are easier to digest for the students. "
"It modifies the topic in way that student can understand by seeing  demonstration and stimulation .It helps  them to interact with teacher ,collaborate with partner and doing experimentation .Teacher can  assess  student  understanding through  interactive exercise and students were excited to learn through multimedia\r\n"
"Collect students' answers and gain in-depth understanding of their reasoning.  In doing so, teachers can develop future lessons based on students' learning progress."
"The most important aspect is that WISE helped students to deeper understand concept of the heat, by visualizing basic principles step by step, in order to build a coherent picture of this complex concept. Students had possibilities to chose simple answers on the questions; make simulations, and predictions. They were playing with very nicely visualized interactive program that encouraged them to think about possible answers and explain their own opinions. After working in WISE, students could test own presumptions in reality, in the environment around them, alone or in the groups. Students collaborated with each otherÈs to find correct answers. They could move in the real space and touch real materials. WISE motivated students to make reflections over their answers and facilitated possibility for each student to think independently end explain own opinion. Students realized the difference in temperature of different materials in the reality, when thinking in three dimensions. WISE technology did not provide them with the correct answers, than stimulated inquiry, encouraged them to measure, investigate and think about explanations. So the learning process was ending with discussions and even more questions.  "
"The WISE activity was very effective in helping students understand the concept of heat by helping to break it down into manageable pieces for the students to digest bit by bit. It also encouraged students to investigate, measure and  test out their predictions with the use of visual manipulative tools, rather than the students just thinking about the topic and trying to figure it all out in their heads. It made their thinking visible and by exercising their ideas and it building a deep understanding of the topic as a result. Students could also collaborate easily with their peers and reflect on their work. There were concrete tools available in the classroom to further aid the investigation rather than just relying on the tools provided in the technology."
"WISE made students being together like unit and shearing their ideas, measurements and thoughts easily and scaffolding their learning. "
"letting them simulate what the knew, testing their predictions, exploring news ideas, all in a collaborative environment."
It helped students to do and reflect about the topic reviewed. It gave students the opportunity to learn through doing.
"Just focusing on one specific, challenging topic within the Thermodynamics lesson made a lot of sense.  The WISE visuals followed by the hands-on experiments produced much greater understanding for the students than the visuals the teacher had presented previously.  The student collaboration allowed the teacher to discover which aspects the students were still confused about so she could focus in on those. "
"I thought the simulation part, that is the one showing the conduction of heat to be most helpful in visualizing the concept for better understanding.\r\nAlso the ability to modify the course plan and be able to appraise each of the students' output is really great at garnering a reliable feedback"
I think the  most effective aspects to help the students were:\r\n- The use of simulations to  to compare how fast heat goes to flow through different materials.\r\n- Touch various materials \r\n- Make and test their own predictions.
I thought that technology helps to motivate students. Also it is interactive. The students get to read and interact in a meaningful way with objects related with what is being taught. Is very important that the teacher observes if the students are learning and she could change the program to this end. 
"The WISE activity showed real applications that the children could then go and explore themselves, for example touching the different materials. It incorporated student reflections / discussions which would help students gain a deeper understanding and had embedded assessments too to provide feedback to the teacher."
"I thought that the most effective ways of helping students learn the topics are the methods of arousing the interest of them. Having intense interest on the topics, they are willing to learn and eager to learn more. From the video I watched, I found that the students were doing the experiments attentively and took part in the activities happily. In fact, the contents about the topic of thermodynamics are not easy. It should be harder for grade seven students. But it seemed that they had no problem. That proved that the students can learn some harder things through some interesting method. I think students can learn better through  the WISE activity."
it is activity based. Use of simulation creates near life (virtual reality) experience for learners that leads to better understanding of the subject topic
Visualizing concepts to understand was effective.\r\nTo see and control what's going on in the experiment themselves would be helpful to faciltate the way to think in science way. \r\n
the part of trying students idea into WISE which gives fun and coriusity to try anything
Sharing ideas on the screen so that the students can share their understanding.\r\nUsing a range of simulations
The fact that the experiment had an unexpected outcome. If students were to find out that a metal table is actually a cooler temperature than a wooden one than their expectations would have been confirmed but they would not have known why. Because there was an unexpected outcome a whole new world of possible questions was opened up and the students could ask a series of questions as to why they got the results that they did. \r\n\r\nEarlier in the activity there were multiple different activities within the WISE program. This meant that if one activity did not immediately make sense to them there was another soon to follow that would address the subject from a different angle. This is more affective than a lecture because they are having the information delivered in a multitude of ways in rapid succession. If a student is able learn a small piece of the whole from each activity they will end the overall lesson with a much more complete understanding. 
"Students will understand better after using WISE platform, this is inquiry based learning.  "
It is the different way of teaching.It helps students to understand subject better.
"There are many interesting aspects of the WISE activity that I thought were effective in helping students. The simple fact that students are able to visualize the concepts presented in the experiments, and that students are able to manipulate the elements of the simulation via the WISE activity is, I think, great. And also, Thermodynamics in the Kitchen, makes the otherwise abstract concepts of Thermodynamics more accessible for students since they can directly connect what they learn in class with their immediate environment, that is, their kitchen. And breaking down rather large and dense concepts into manageable chunks through the simulations helps students digest concepts more readily and easily.  ItÈs one way to tell students that Thermodynamics operates around us and itÈs completely another way to show them that it does really work around us by having them experience it. And that is one area where the WISE activity is also successful at. And on top of all that, the WISE platform gives the students scenarios to reflect, collaborate, and engage on. When student were allowed to test their predictions about scenarios in the WISE activities, such as touching actual materials in the classroom, itÈs inquiry based learning at work. Learners are not just given the right answers. Instead, theyÈre up and about investigating, measuring, collaborating and thinking about the possible ways to explain what they observe while at the same time giving them the opportunity to formulate and test their ideas. And keeping a record of what the students has measured, experimented, predicted or reflected on also makes it concrete for learners of what theyÈve learned. This in turn can help learners build a greater understanding of concepts. These are the aspects that IÈve noted about the WISE activity that makes it effective."
Learning by doing\r\nPracticing to aquire knowledge makes it easier to leRn than conventional methods of teaching. 
That they experience the learning themselves and they are the centered based learning.
"Important aspects of the WISE activity which helped the students learn the topics effectively were as follow:\r\nIt helped the students reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with their partners and make and test their predictions.\r\nMoreover, it encouraged them to search, investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations without providing them the right answers directly.  In addition to the aforementioned aspects of the WISE activity, it also broke down concepts into very small, manageable pieces and then this helped the kids scaffold their ideas and build a coherent understanding through working with the Wise activity.\r\n \r\n"
The most effective part of the WISE activity for me was the simulation at the molecular level. This would have been difficult to see normally and according to the teacher this was one of area of the WISE lesson that produce an understanding that is normally difficult to achieve. When technology allows us to go to areas we would have found impossible in a normal class then it is really beneficial and not just and efficient alternative. There were many other areas that were effective but these could have achieve in the classroom without technology although not as effective or efficiently as with the WISE program.

"I liked that students are taught to think for themselves and there is no wrong or right answer when testing different objects, i.e. students testing the temperature of glass and metal."
"The WISE activity used technology to break down the difficult concepts into smaller manageable pieces.  The WISE system also provided essential guidance to keep students on track so the teacher could move around the room. The simulations and graphocs hlped to make an abstract concept into a manipulative.  Equally important, the teacher had the ability to schedule enough time for each lesson day"
"Some aspects I thought were helpful were:\r\n*Predictions\r\n*Open-ended exploration (teachers don't just give the right answer, they allow students to find it)\r\n*A platform that enables teachers to see student work and flag anonymous comments for sharing - this makes it much easier to share student work in a private but useful way\r\n*The ability to individualize WISE to better connect to students' background knolwedge."
"Breaking the content down into more manageable pieces and illustrating concepts through diagrams and simulations. The WISE activity also allowed students to navigate the content at their own pace. Rather than simply being presented with all the answers, students were exposed to pertinent pieces of information and guided towards synthesising this information in order to draw their own conclusions."
I think cooperative learning in general and Kagan structures in particular
"She can  access the various kinds of ideas and comments  that students are bringing into the lesson  using the assessment tool this feature can be used to focus student attention on a particular activity for a class discussion or to control the pacing of student progress,\r\nalso she can flag interesting, specific  response  to share, discuss, or review (anonymously) with the whole class. This feature allows her to whether individualized or class-wide interventions are necessary.\r\nshe is able to pause their WISE work and to hold spontaneous discussions, she can use the assessment tool to send them quick comments about their work, these comments that students can review and reflect on.\r\n"
"I believe that the most effective Wise activity are: 1) The possibility to verify patterns and theory in models that may imply every-day situation. 2) The possibility to work in group and to inquiry about the problem, through the Wise platform. 3) The kind of moderation offer by the teacher: she can correlate easier group problems, strategies and questions. 4) The use of simulations"
"In my opinion the most effective aspect it's that WISE activity breaks down concepts so that is very important , because students can build up new knowledge in a more manageable way, by their own."
"WISE allows the students to investigate, measure and think about the possible explanations. It keeps the students on track. Discussing the ideas collected through the assessment tool during a projection help the students come across new ideas and possible a new perception of the topic. The teacher can identify where the each student is stuck and help the student individually or in small groups tomove forward. WIse activity breaks down concepts making it easier to understand."
"organization, active listening and reading, summarizing the notes, concentration, and finally using the effective time to learn"
"In my opinion students are much more involved because they can act personally, directly and are able to confront their opinions each other. Perhaps, simulations are not the same thing as reality; however, it surely represents an effective way to approch every kind of topic, so that students become more aware over real experiments done in the lab."
"Teaching with the demos of topics like thermodynamics in which a student learns various characteristics of  materials, with regard to heat capacity, and heat transfer. Further it also reflects on various scenarios, collaborate with partners, and to make and test their predictions. Students use simulations to compare how fast heat\r\n will flow through different materials. This makes the students to understand easy concept, and it brings up many different ideas.  The WISE learning web tool don't just try to tell the kids the right answer, but rather it encourage them to investigate, measure, and think. \r\n    about the possible explanations.\r\n"
it allowed students to visualize and experience with their own hands new difficult to get concepts. also the idea of breaking bigger concepts into smaller ones is true.\\as it is very difficult to introduce a new concept for the first time regardless of the student age
"I think the fact that the teacher has control over the WISE activity helps them to break it down into small, manageable pieces.  Since the teacher can view student discussion and activity, this is a great tool for formative assessment.  Using the formative assessment, the teacher can scaffold student learning as the activity progresses. "
"This is not the time to become extremely self-centered and arrogant. Keep in mind that employers are often looking for team players rather than Lone Rangers. A good response to this question may relate to a mentor/and or philosophy of work or the people you work with. Also, use this question as an opportunity to inquire about an appropriate fit for success with this company. For example,\r\n\r\nMany years ago I learned an important lesson from Bob Nelson, who was my first supervisor and really became my most important mentor. He told me his secret to success was to 'Look at each day as a new opportunity to be your very best. Set high goals, be honest, never say no, and work with people who share your passion for doing their best.' I've always remembered that advice and try to live it every day. I am very self motivated, determined and honest. I really love what I do and I try to surround myself with people who share similar passions. I thrive on this type of environment. Am I likely to find this environment with your company? Can you tell me a little more about the characteristics of successful people at your company? What do you see as some of the key success factors for this position?"
1) Maneouvrability : it has the facility to adapt according to learners' requirements and also to the way the learning is progressing.  \r\n2) Simulation: able to demonstrate visually real life situations along with the operation of the relevant concept and scientific process.\r\n3) Engages the learner.\r\n4) Helps reduce fear among learners if a difficult concept or idea is to be learnt by him or her.
"The images and the virtual lab. A lot of my students are visual learners and if you do not have materials for a hands on labs, virtual labs are the next best thing."
"- Providing scaffolding for learning\r\n- Allowing aha moments coming from the difference between what was expected and what was observed, necessity to adapt to these surprises\r\n- Having more individualized support\r\n- Room for peer instruction"
"I think that one of the most effective parts of the WISE activity was the ability of the students to combine the inquiry based practical activities, such as the comparison of various object temperatures, with the reinforcement and assessment provided by the WISE programs and tools. This helps by providing an integrated system with would help keep the students learning consistent. I also think that the WISE activity is effective is because it helps the teacher in keeping track of the students' learning progress and where they may need extra attention. By collating the information for the teacher and providing easy access it allows the teacher to more easily differentiate the program to supplement the WISE program with more individualised instruction."
It provides student with live interactive activities and experiments that spurs greater understand and saves much time compared to conducting practical experiments in labs. \r\n\r\nStudents are given the opportunity to learn in a more creative and visual way with different speed as every student process information at different speed. 
I thought having the flexibility of copying the whole lessons or customising the lessons was really great.   It allows each teacher to grow as well when using the tool.\r\nThe progress tracking piece for each student is really useful to allow the teacher to assess the progress in tangible terms. 
they could see a very abstract idea represented with graphics and check their theories.
"I believe as a teacher that learning is a constructive process, so I see the Wise activity as an appealing and meaningful manner to break down knowledge and let students contruct  it by means of experience and interaction. This an effective way to empower learning as well as students are able to understand difficult topics in a easy and entertainning manner."
"¢  Pupils collaborate with partners.\r\n¢  Students can test their predictions and use simulations.\r\n¢ Wise activities don't just try to tell the kids the right answer, but rather they encourage them to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.\r\n"
"The breaking down on a concept into smaller pieces, then letting the teacher help the students take those pieces and act as a scaffold to build the pieces into an idea, or the concept itself. By letting the students find out for themselves how a certain concept works, the idea sticks way better into their heads. Not to forget that only by seeing the whole concept, you can finally zoom out and see the inter-conceptual connections that are linked to that one concept."
I think that the images and the ability to interact were helpful. The fact that they could get almost immediate individual feedback was also effective.
"The teacher can use assessment tools, make instant comments. We are able to pause the work. The students can work in small groups, collect the reflections. It is easy to make copy of any lessons, for my students, and I can edit and share with my colleagues. "
"Web-based technology for Inquiry in Science Environment and making o easy the difficult concepts and using of active learning instructional aspects or strategies and also ' Doing by learning' ,  also called as  Activity based learing are some aspects of the WISE activity that i thought were most effective, in terms of helping students learn the topics or concepts."
"Visualization of the experiments, hands-on problems, collaboration within the group, discussions. See the particles simulation that is impossible in real life."
"The first aspect WISE activity I thought it was really effective, was the fact that made students feel really motivated and engaged in the activities, which is a great point reached in this Project, once students on this age, learning this topic usually feel bored.\r\nThe second aspect I admired was the fact that students learned new things, new concepts by trying, by experimenting, by seeing how everything Works in real life.\r\nAlso, very interesting the way they learned, I think they had the oportunity to build the concepts by themselves in a very collaborative way.\r\n"
"Several important aspects of the WISE activity such as making predictions ( hypothesis), testing the student's ability to make an assumption of what he or she now. WISE activity encourages students to think, research and investigate the answer, while being supervised by the teacher. The teacher can keep track of their previous and current answers, and follow up their progress. What is important to note, some students might be very shy to answer in front of their classmate. Such activity will allow them to express freely their thoughts and ideas."
"Students use simulations to compare how fast heat will flow via different materials, and this became very effective when the used their sense of TOUCHING rather than just listening to the lesson in their classroom, and I see that this interaction got them into the job and they will NEVER forget how they felt.\r\nAlso SEEING the chocolate melts have the same effect on them."
The possibility to visualize the Tonic and that the topic is put into small pieces that encourage Students to work On them without Leaving them in Front of a huge amount of information. The combination of Technology and hands-On experiences seem perfect for me.
it was very helpful for us to conduct a simple and easy expirements
Using the simulations allows the student to see the theory in practice. I also feel that when they are physically able to associate the relationship between the theory and its application this allows the barrier of coming to an understanding to diminish or even be eliminated.
"It broke down a concept that could be difficult for students to understand into manageable pieces so they could build up knowledge. Also, the ability to visualize non observable concepts like heat transfer ( you cannot see heat transferring).\r\nAlso they had control over what they were doing allowing them to go at their own pace."
the animations and self paced timing helped compared to when she did simulations in class because the animations were self paced and set context and allowed students to make predictions and test test their predictions
"A web-based  system that gives the students the opportunity to work collaboratively with different peers by going through moments of prediction and reflection to test their previous predictions about the topics and concepts being investigated and explored autonomously. After learning a little bit about SAMR I would add that WISE also allows the creation of new tasks and activities that were once more difficult to achieve by students individually, this way learning was in fact transformed by the use of technology."
"WISE is a new tool that allows students to understand in an easier way some of the most difficult concepts. It provides a new environment where students are able to experiment through the web-page and make their own predictions in the real life. This method give a new approach for the students, a new way to understand the processes. Then they can compare their predictions with the real results and acquire this knowledge."
"to give student right answers,and increase student attention through encourage to think in solution and to understand"
"Scaffolding the material and the ability to monitor students' progress, including whether they are on the right track in coming to understand the topic are both valuable."
"As Jennifer herself said, the fact that the wise activity deconstructed in various concepts that kids could digest better offering visualizations for each one."
"Students were encouraged to reflect on scenarios , collaborate with partners and to make and test predictions."
"I thought it was important that the WISE activity broke down the concepts into smaller, more manageable chunks for the students to master before being helped to build those concepts into the larger overall concept of heat transfer.\r\nThe animations appeared to be particularly useful for this topic which involves a sense of movement. Students weren't having to construct a mental picture of movement from a static image, such as on the board or page - the animation was a natural fit for this concept and may have helped strengthen students' own visual conceptualisations.\r\nFinally, I think that the fact that the students are encouraged to actually take measurements, make practical observations as part of the activity rather than simply being told that the temperature will be the same even if they feel different should spark wonder and sense of curiousity, driving a desire to understand why."
I liked how it engaged them with the subject and then they went and moved around the room and came back for follow up.  I think students that are active in their lessons with specific purpose gain more understanding.  I enjoyed seeing the animation during the lesson for those students who may not even realize they don't understand the topic.  The automatic feedback to the teacher was especially nice to have for quick assessment and discussions.\r\n
"The most effectives aspects were that students were involved in their own learning and that through technology, they were able to prove and test as if they were in a lab."
"I think it is really important to guide students a web-based system. In this way, they have the opportunity to reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners, and to make and test their predictions. They have contact with what they are studying having the chance to test, to compare and other things. I believe they learn much more because of this. "
"I felt that the on-screen simulations were very effective. To connect a concept with a mental image makes it easier for students to remember.. Also, the ability to show student questions to the class and discuss answers as a group "
"Jennifer mentioned that, though her students loved the nice pictures in her demo, the demos themselves were not the learning experiences for the students, but more like the introduction. The WISE activity seemed most effective in that it helped students really learn about heat, heat transfer and the heat capacity of different materials by breaking down concepts into manageable pieces. Unlike a demo, students worked in groups and were about to work at their own paces as they engaged with the WISE virtual simulations and then the hands-on experimenting. They worked socially. They reflected individually. They had multiple experiences with the material. Jennifer had the freedom to observe and talk with students to understand and prompt their continued learning AND she had the tools of WISE that helped her analyze student responses to asses their learning and respond in class discussions."
"Thoses aspects are: collaboration between students,  simulations, investigation, thinking about the possible explanations. "
"To begin the students will be captivated by the fact that this is a lesson that uses lots of technology. The lesson is guided by a web-base system where the students can reflect on scenarios, collaborate with partners, and  make and test their predictions. Those three aspects are very important for students learning. I believe that students learn best in groups when they are collaborating over a topic. I also feel that students learn best when they have an opportunity to test their theorist and can try and prove themselves wrong."
"Giving the students an opportunity to explore, investigate, predict, and test their hypotheses is one of the most effective aspects of the WISE activity in helping students understand the concept of heat and heat transfer.  The simulations and opportunity to test out the different materials in the classroom help students be a part of the learning, and can cater to the varied learning styles of students. "

"WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students, scaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up to a more coherent understanding.\r\n"
"I thought the simulations were excellent. With topic areas that are abstract or difficult to conceptualise, seeing an example simulation helped to break down a challenging topic in ways that students could understand. WISE is dynamic enough to allow for a number of different tools to be used to break down the activities - simulations, reflections, predictions, that could easily be worked into real-life practical activities that complement the online tool. It provided an organised scaffold for learning in this example. "
They could experience Theory and read about different experiences in order to get the concepts clear
"There were several aspects of the Wise activity that I believed led to learning. First as the students were working through the simulation they had to constantly answer questions and provide feedback. Second as the teacher circulated the classroom she could answer any additional questions student had, or even assess student learning and direct the students as needed. Finally what I found most intriguing is that students were asked to find objects and apply the concepts they had just learned in this case was to touch metals and non metals in the classroom and understand why some feel colder than others even if they are at the same temperature. I noticed a student even had a laser thermometer what I could see in the video this extra part really got the students attention and lead to a deep engagement in the part of the students. "
The activity broke down concepts into smaller pieces that were easier for students to understand.\r\nStudents were completely engaged in the activity.\r\nTeacher could easily access student answers and put them up for discussion.  \r\nAllowed the teacher to check student understanding find out where there might be problems of understanding.
Students are at the center of all activities\r\nStudents learn collaboratively\r\nStudents performed various experiments (online as well as offline) and build their own concepts\r\n
The practical examples they had to understand the complex and abstract concept of heat. The fact that they could translate this concept from a written idea to a definition they could comprehend because now they can see how it works in real life.
The visuals were impressive because they helped students interact to understand the concept.  Also the program's breakdown of sub-skills to accomplish complete understanding was ideal.  The scaffolding of these ideas helped students grow at their own rate.  All of the students were engaged in their learning and the teacher was able to pick out students based on assessment scores and pinpoint specific works to reference on front screen.  
Allowing the the students to use  the concepts that they learned in a practical way to gain a better understanding of the information. 
through simulations and learning experiments can make the student to think better.\r\ninquiry and interactive sessions will also help students to understand the concepts clearly
"I found it interesting Wise platform, as students are encouraged to investigate a theme, to exchange information and interact with colleagues, so in an environment of interaction they learn more. And the teacher can follow their ideas to analyze and put some questions to the group."
"Instead of lecturing to the students giving the opportunity of facing with a question, prediction of answers and testin in a visual interface to see results gives much more productive learning experience."
The simulation gave the students to opportunity to evaluate different scenarios of how heat relates with different material.  The students were able to use the collaboration tool to share and consolidate their ideas and findings to come with a reasonable conclusion on their findings. The making and the testing of their experiments gave them to opportunity to have real life experience and be better at making predicts and critically analyzing the results.
"There is a step-by-step progression for students, which is designed to flesh out any confusion or wrong directions.  It is designed the way we learn.  It is engaging  - topic-wise, activity-wise.  I think that students who do the readings would have a great time, feel encouraged in their progress throughout, and feel like they had learned something as well through these clearly laid out steps.  It gives ample practice and repetition for each new idea raised.  "
"I feel firstly having an interactive learning process, using technology, would immediately create interest and curiosity  for students. In addition, being given a level of autonomy in their learning empowers students and helps to make them feel responsible for their own learning. The WISE activity gave visuals of the effects of heat, which give clearer understandings for students to grasp concepts. The WISE activity also broke down the learning process into accessible stages, which scaffolded the students understanding. The stages also allow for opportunity for discussion between peers and their teacher, to learn from each other further. "
"to guide and to demonstrate the students, exposing them to actual project activities."
"For one, the tasks were scaffolded and secondly, they dealt with real world experience, which the students were able to test such as which object (wood or metal) would feel cooler."
The activity involved work with peers.  It was a different appoach rather than one more day of a steady diet of the same approach.
 wise is web based system\r\n and test their prediction\r\nand copy of lesson 
"So even though I'm technically teaching a grade seven course,\r\nI'm actually covering two years worth of science curriculum.\r\nI've got two other colleagues that I'm collaborating with,\r\nand overall, we've got four sections of science.\r\n"
They were hands on and real life examples.  They were able to explore real life scenarios that were not just something in a textbook but they experienced before.  A lot of time students feel that science is beyond them but this brings it down to their personal experience. 
"Simulations and visuals because students can make and test their own predictions, compare how heat spreads in different materials."
I love the constructivist approach; allowing students to experiment and explore first. A range of visuals and activities is great. I also think it's great that you can modify the lessons to suit your school and students needs.
Students had the change to experiment themselves with some simulation activities so they could learn the concep easily.
This and that This and thatThis and thatThis and thatThis and thatThis and thatThis and that
"-the students are able to explore things\r\n- they can do experiments y themselves \r\n- They also make predictions\r\n- they are  encouraged  to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.\r\n- the students are bringing into the lesson and track the way that their understanding develops\r\n- a WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students,scaffolds them, to kind of build those ideas up to a more coherent understanding.\r\n\r\n"
"I like how the WISE activity allowed students to build and develop their understanding of the concept of heat that was being taught. It allowed the students to see, interact, and explore the ideas for the concepts and build their own understanding of that concept. "
"Breaking the more complicated concepts of thermodynamics into manageable pieces, the visuals, and the ability for students to use the interactive activities both in and outside of the LMS all seemed quite effective. The ability for students to pace themselves a bit and (it was not clear from the video, but I image it's the case) have some autonomy in approaching the scaffolding is a somewhat less linear way is also useful. I appreciated seeing students up and about with what appeared to be a thermometer to take measurements in the real world. "
"The simulations seemed to be most helpful, as they allowed students to visualize the small particles, so important to an understanding of heat transfer, which are impossible to see during live demonstrations. The live demonstrations were important, though, for igniting curiosity.  Then the simulations allowed the students to dig deeper. "
"WISE can be used to plan, create and share lessons with both colleagues and students.\r\nWISE can effectively enable that teacher track the learners' study progress, by following up their ideas, for example flagging interesting answers, putting comments, and evaluating their work. \r\nWISE makes it possible for the learners to inquire through making predictions, and reflecting on scenarios among their peers. "
The division of the concepts and units into very small pieces so the student can understand better the situation. I also like the part where they get control of their own learning situation.
I like the interactive nature of the students using tactile sense to explore the science concept. The questioning and processing the raw data was very effective.
"Assessment that is built in. The ability to modify the activities and questions so the lesson can be tailored to meet individual classes. The way a teacher can stop the lesson and address misconceptions and questions as the students work, this is an excellent way to use the formative assessment tools that are built in."
"EVEN Being in Virtual Environment hum hum investigative She had character , and STILL THE reflected Students About phenomena of his day to day , Getting More engaged"
"WISE activity has allowed students to investigate a new topic independently and more deeply than traditional methods. It encouraged the students to experiment and share their thoughts. Thanks to the ability to immediately analyze the response of the students by the teacher, this method has allowed to stretch out immediate requests, find the most interesting answers, which could serve as topics for further discussion and indicate which points of the subject are not yet entirely clear."
"I believe that the possibility of experimenting and feeding the WISE platform with the results they obtained each stage is significant. Labs experiments are quite common in science classes, but feeding the platform with the small results and based on that being able to move forward on the direction of a bigger result/conclusion boosted the learning process, in my idea.\r\nInstead of receiving the answer from the teacher, they experimented, analyzed, discussed and got to a conclusion by themselves. This whole process made them learn much more effectively. Cognitively, the information makes much more sense for them now than if it was just something passively received.\r\n"
the platform that created for all activities like sharing the ideas and do their exercise.
"I liked that WISE breaks down larger more complex scientific concepts into small, manageable pieces so students are not overwhelmed."
"               The WISE platform can help students learn some specific challenging topics that usually meet a diversity of opinions. This is done by means of activities that can break down the concepts connected to a concrete topic, into smaller pieces that are easier for students to be understood. The studentsÈ role in these activities is to make predictions to the simulations offered by the program, test them by measuring and investigation, and give answers with their conclusions. That is the good point of the WISE program, i.e. it gives the right answer only after the students investigated and formed their own ideas. The whole process of work implies the use of analysis and critical thinking that makes students understand deeply the concepts connected to a concrete topic."
The students can see the theory and practice simultaneously.  They can repeat the problem solving again and again.
"The accessibility of information both students who can solve your doubted things from simple to complex, and teacher who has direct access to the development of the student's reasoning."
I think the most effective WISE activety was to make students why by letting them experience. Students then try to find the answer themselves actively.
"Students can make predictions in the platform and test them in the classroom. The teacher could hold/pause the activity and have a classroom discussion about the activity.\r\n\r\nAlso, WISE encourages kids to investigate, measure and think."
"being engaged, critical thinking, inquiry and self discovery. There was also simulations that helped students to learn deeply and easily analyze the content."
"I think the platform WISE like an important part of the learning process in the mentioned case. A technological tool where students can explore and think about determination theme, improving their knowledge, sharing ideas and making their predictions. But, it is not complete. It serves to complement the studies about the theme proposed by the teacher, who is responsible to engage it with lectures, explanations, videos. The platform should be seen by students as a challenge, therefore its structure of presentation should be attractive, easy to understand and affordable to connect the ideas among all of them, including the teacher.\r\nIt is not self sufficient and I think the technology as an environment to learn, to research and to build the own knowledge. Learning with the technology have not been seen under the right perspective, it is because several teachers and schools are not prepared to teach students using this way."
"Being able to hypothesize and then immediately see the action occur, thus getting instant feedback on their thoughts seemed great. They don't have long enough to convince themselves that their incorrect answer is right and don't hear other good-natured, but incorrect explanations that may confuse them. I also liked that the teacher could pause everyone's, since something so interesting would make paying attention to the teacher less exciting!"
"Simulations that it included. Opportunity to make it with every one's own speed and not all together, so it provides a good way to individualize teaching/learning."
"The teacher encourages students to research, experiment and share their experiences with others."
"I thought the simulation was very helpful, and I also felt the hands-on, especially melting the chocolate chips was super!"
it's advance learning tactics and students involvement and motivation for the new tool.
"The students collaborate with partners, make and test their predictions. Encourage the students to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.\r\n"
"The WISE activity allows experimentation, research , teamwork , thorough understanding of the concept by the students."
"To start off, I could see that one of the most relevant points for me is the fact that students get in touch with the things they are learning; they can see what is happening around them and can intertact with the situation.\r\nSecondly, the use of technology makes them more interested in learning and/or new things."
"It allows to collect the previosus ideas of your students. It gives you hints to do assessments and find out wht your students are understanding and what coulbd be wrong in the process. It gives students lots of resources to visualize the phenomena, proove their initial hyphoteses and build up new ideas with some sense and coherence. That can help teacher to monitor progress and find out how students advanced from the initial ideas to clearer concepts."
"Allowing students to critically think, evaluate and analyze topics. It also helped Jennifer in terms of granting her insight into her students ideas."
"In the presentation Jennifer mentioned a WISE activity breaks down concepts into very small, manageable pieces, and then it helps the students, scaffolds them, to kind of build up those ideas to a more coherent understanding.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of the activity I find very effective.  I can appreciate that building up / scaffolding concept as students at times find if difficult to put together all that they have learned into very simple language.  \r\n\r\nI was amazed at data collection in spite of the collaboration with other instructors.  This dynamic quality makes providing instruction ensures that the teacher is teaching the lesson that he is best in.  Moreover, what I found  most effective is , the ability to tailor different question / activities to meet the backgrounds of her students.  This means a lot to me as an educator as I am aware that student connectivity to their learning has a lot to do with the relevancy of the subject to their history and lives."
Be only slightly beyond students' current levels of proficiency\r\nRegularly demonstrate studentsÈ understanding throughout the activity\r\nUse peer modelling\r\nInclude feedback that helps students make progress.
"The WISE activity is effective because it allows students to use simulations to compare how fast heat will flow through different materials.  It allows for hands-on activity, discovery, and discussions. The students were engaged and helped each other."
The activity created a lesson that used several modes of learning. It allowed the students to bring their own experiences created from the lesson to help connect them with the material in a practical way. The activity also created an opportunity for students to understand a complex idea one small portion at a time through the use of a scaffolding lesson. Each portion of the lesson builds up the students' understanding of the material.
"I think that the fact of involving the students with the topic in a technological way, makes them more aware of the objective of the topic. \r\nThe examples given were far more understandable for them than just mentioning them or looking at some pictures of a book. Jennifer makes it even better by using realia (when she asks them to touch the objects around the classroom). I found it really interesting and original."
"I like the accountability WISE presents. I remember in my chemistry course how I would have to write everything down in the notebook predicting what would happen in the case of any laboratory experiment. However, WISE already has these open and ready for the students. Yet, WISE allows for a choice of what may happen, not concrete answers. After, the activity of touching the iron and chocolate then settles the answer. I like how the students can come to their own conclusion after experimentation. To me, this would have been most effective had I learned that way."
allowing the students to understand the concepts on their own and through personal reflections.
"Wise seems to be really helpful since students get actively engadged in their understanding about a certain topic. It was really nice to see how students started predecting about the possible temperature material might have. That's incredible. I think that by using this technology, students become in the protagonist of their own learning process."
"Chunking, visuals, the ability to go through cycles of inquiry quickly (kind of like fast prototyping)"
"To reflect on various scenarios and collaborate with partners, using simulations and making and testing their predictions. The teacher can access all of their ideas using the assessment tool and bring it on the front projector for discussion"
The student can using all of sense on body. It cause them can think more deeply and widely.
more easily to understand the topics for the students with visual presentations\r\n
It helps in making predictions and noticing the applications of a concept
use of simulation and hand on activities and sharing of results with discussions on some selected questions. 
"guidness\r\nmake and test the student predictions\r\nstudents can use a simulations \r\nmaking predictions\r\nnot only tell the kids the right anser but it encourage them to investigate,measure, think about the possible explanations \r\nkeeping the kids track  collecting there reflections and measurements and scaffolding their learning\r\n"
"I believe that WISE has 2 important features that helped students learn the topic at hand: \r\n\r\n1. The layout of the lesson, where the lesson was divided into smaller concepts and introduced each concept through a small activity.\r\n\r\n2. Visual support where students will be able to see how things work or interact. "
"I think that chunking, breaking concepts into small, approachable pieces has always proved effective for many students. We want students to understand the concepts and think about what the question entails. Some students are able to perform multi-step computations because they're good at memorizing and performing rote steps. This is not the best way for students to understand and learn the beauty of mathematics. They need time to be able to generate the overall picture and how different parts of mathematics are integrated."
"- Divide the task into smaller pieces and then put them together in order to give coherence and understanding.\r\n- Make use of scientific experimentation with pre issues and post experiment with increasing difficulty levels.\r\n- Relate the concepts to students' daily facts (which is the part where they have greater difficulty, as I have noticed in my daily practice)."
The aspect of getting the students engaged while also learning. They get the fact and experience it. In this type of learning students do not only absorb the facts but live with them.
"The possibility to compare processes, hand-on activities, visual dynamism of experiments."
"ETF students are accelerated in science, starting in grade seven.\r\nSo even though I'm technically teaching a grade seven course,\r\nI'm actually covering two years worth of science curriculum.\r\nI've got two other colleagues that I'm collaborating with,\r\nand overall, we've got four sections of science.\r\n"
I really like the use of interactive diagrams in helping students visualize difficult-to-readily-understand science concepts.
"From viewing the video I learned that WISE activity allows students to be engaged using a web-based program, it allows them to collaborate, make predictions, and to receive feedback from the teacher, who can follow after their progress and their understanding of the concepts.\r\nWISE provides visual to help students understand concepts. \r\n"
The control over the curriculum also the use of the visual learning.
"I realize that reflect on various scenarios, collaborate with partners, make and test the possibilities, use simulations to compare, predict, give meaning to the concepts and approach the student's knowledge through the possible combinations that this activity has at WISE. Not only information transmitted to the students, the WISE enables knowledge is presented in a concrete way for the student, which can assist students in learning through associations, which seems to me fundamental. Also the fact after the simulations can touch the objects involved and experience the situation transformed the experience and probably the concepts have greater meaning. Transform our students into research must be one of the teacher's goals and how the WISE project was created not only to say the right answer to the children but to encourage them to research, assess and think about the possible explanations, I consider fundamental for students live those possibilities."
Using the WISE activity in class enables students to reflect on their work and colaborate with peers. Both reflection and colaboration are essential in students learning and understanding of the material given.
"Using WISE they can use webs, collaborate with other students and reflect on what they have done. And as with inquiry instead of the teacher asking a question and giving the answer they are letting the students conduct their own investigation. The teach was able to flag question and bring them up in class anonymously letting students feel comfortable and giving them the opportunity to have a discussion. "
"Some of these aspects are:\r\n* Engage the students in discussions about the topic, then they gained more interest to learn it.\r\n*Students could share relevant information and their point of views, discussing each element from the topic.\r\n*Web based activities like WISE activities allowed students collaborate with partners, make some predictions about experiments and interact with concepts.\r\n*Different kind of informations gathered in this activity and showed through images, text, questions and interactive designs stimulate studentÈs learning.\r\n"
"I think students were enganged to the hole activity because they've seen what happen before they tryit in real life, it was like a book of what happen if you?... and then children had a lot of new ideas to probe and catch the assesment."
let the student to think and investigate and find the truth 
wise is a good platform to learn thermodynamics through vision and through interactive teaching
WISE helped students to visualize the subject by videos and simulations. Students work in groups and ask questions. By this way teacher can figure out the topics students can or cannot understand.  
"The most effective aspect of WISE was that it let the students learn things by trying them on their own. This would take them to the whole process of understanding in a natural way for the brain, which leads to deeper understanding, and everybody had a chance to get to results and answers at a different pace without worrying about who gets it right first and who never gets it at all because they did not have enough time to think about it on their own. "
To explane and give evidence in lectures to be more strong to discuss with colleague
The activities where the students conducted experiments under different circumstances. It allowed them to gain a better understanding of the concepts. 
"Capacity building and institutional strengthening, long term benefit; Sustainability, transferability, participatory process, consensus building and effective and efficient communication process."
"The technology-enhanced inquiry carried out using an activity from WISE led to students working collaboratively to find answers. The students did so as autonomous learners. The site allowed the teacher to collect students responses and questions while they were working on the different activities. The focus was on the students' process of learning. The students could predict and later on test their predictions by touching the different materials to check the different temperatures. The  kids were encouraged to investigare, measure and in doing so they were able to come to conclusions. The teacher didn't lecture on the topic of thermodynamics,  but rather she let her students discover for themselves. "
"The WISE activity was effective in breaking down complex lessons by using visual representations like animations, asking questions that lead to a better understanding of the concept, "
I believe the connection with real life.this one is most important thing so that we as teachers help the students realise more complex consepts as math.
The breaking of the material into small topics that scaffolded their integration into more complex topics. The greater time the teacher had to talk with individuals and small groups.
Some aspects of the WISE activity that are most effective are the simulations and the way that the students can make predictions and prove their thoughts.
Students can presume when they are learning from WISE and then they can check if their presunctions were correct in class or in a lab. They also build their own understanding.
I guess the practical demo and the simulations are the most effective aspects of the activity
"Considering my undergrad students, I guess the most effective aspect would be interactive visualizations."
The interaction students had with the simulations where they were able to experiment and check their understanding as well as demonstrate their ideas.
Aspects of the WISE activity were most effective in terms of helping students learn the topics:\r\n- interactivity\r\n- control
"I really liked the opportunity for students to make predictions and then test those predicted. I think students benefit greatly from the various simulations. Tracking is a great feature. The ability to pause is wonderful, as is the ability to share feedback and comments. Student engagement findings were very strong and promising. Interesting to learn that visual demonstrations were much less effective. "
The WISE has a visual and dynamic resource which provided to students an interaction with heat conduction. Traditionally students learn through books or expositive classes. The use of technology makes necessary rethinking the time and restructure the topics that will be exposed in class. Using the WISE activity has optimized the time and then it has motivated students to investigate heat conduction. The students can simulate heat exchange between different objects made of metal and wood. Through interaction it was visible the advancement and understanding of class about worked content.
The simulators is the best tool for learning. The oportunity of real experience is very very important for learning. The youngers like experience and sharing.
"Students were able to make their own predictions through a WISE activity and they were able to use simulations to play with their ideas. They were also able to collaborate as a group and share their ideas through the WISE activity, which encourages classroom discussion on the topic."
WISE activity is useful of science topics and to construct the concept very easily. With WISE the scare and difficulty of science concept can make easy and first hand experience. Learners can recall and re-apply for different concepts. It's really very useful for most of the concept's clarification.
that we don't need to give them answers instead they can search to find it
WISE activity helped students visualize the concept of heat through all these simulations and offered them the opportunity to break the heat concept to manageable  smaller concepts.
how they can make predictions about the behavior of heat through different materials. That way the teacher is able to route the final conclusions based on as students logic works vs. reality
I like the way that students can experiment and they have to make predictions. This shows very well how they are really learning the material.
"I think the interactive aspects of the tool, made easy to teach, that challenging subject. Also the WISE flexibility in terms of making changes helped Jennifer to adapt the platform for the students.  "
"aspects of the WISE activity that I thought were most effective \r\ndon't just try to tell the kids the right answer,but rather they encourage them to investigate, measure, and think about the possible explanations.\r\nWISE makes it easy for me to access the various kinds of ideas that students are bringing into the lesson and track the way that their understanding develops.\r\nuse the assessment tool to send them quick comments about their work.\r\nWISE does a good job of keeping the kids track, collecting their reflections and measurements, and scaffolding their learning.\r\nThe WISE lesson let students really develop a deeper understanding of the concept of heat."

I thought that the visual simulations were helpful as well as the tailoring teachers are allowed to do. I like that you are able to edit the questions on the platform and the overall lessons. This allows for the teacher to meet the interest and needs of students.
I think it's good to have posibilities to try possibilities in the web and don't get hurt. The students could try different options and don't get hurt.
"The most effective aspects are the possibilities for try, testing your questions. The site gives possibilities for various tests, which arouses the curiosity of the student."
"The concept which was linked to real life experience was most effective , students will learn and enquire about the topic and will edify their misconception."
By participating in the investigation students contribute to the teaching and learning environment. I think empowering the student in the search for knowledge is the the most effective way of engaging a student. 
Some aspects of the WISE activity will make the students think creatively. Students have questions at the back thier mind that make Jennifer more enthusiastic to modify the lessons.The simulations make the students excited and more eager to do the activitie because its a first hand activity that they can learn . They are the once doing the expriment themselves.
"I think the most effective idea was not to answer the questions first but to let them think investigate,measure and think the possible explanations and later discuss about it taking each groups views. It will help them understand the topics much deeper."
"questions for personal reflections, collaboration with peers, visual examples, monitoring their progress"
Simulation of real things  and maybe it's kinda of brain storming which help student to memorize the info. 
"It gives the student to think, visualize  and feel the concept behind the thing happening around them.\r\nIt provides better understanding of the topics.\r\nWISE help you in managing the topic to make it more understandable."
The interaction appears to be the most effective aspects that can help in WISE activity to achieve best of the results needed in particular activity.
I thought the experiential learning embedded in the WISE activity and the computer-animated illustrations specific to each example were most effective. I also think that the edit options embedded in the WISE activity design could be extremely effective in personalizing the lesson to the students' needs and lives. 
experimenting freely like touching the metals and reflecting on it
all the aspects were good all the aspects were good all the aspects were good
"- it allowed students to set up, run simulations and observe the results for concepts that were hard to visualise or see in a lab setting. They had to estimate result and then asses the actual result: this was a deeper learning experience than watching the teacher talk, or model through labs.\r\n- the WYSE program broke up the class into small chunks: students could work through it at their individual pace and level of knowledge (Zone of Proximal Development) and be scaffolded by the course and the teacher.\r\n- the interactive , Q&A nature of the material allowed the teacher to see where the students were struggling and then she could expand or change tack to help the learners meet the class's goal."
i like this thiing abou class activities during online studies
"The socio-constructive framework and the role of teacher as facilitator, were essential, I think. Also, scaffolding is vital, and adopting a bottom-up inductive rather that deductive stance, with hands-on experiments is paramount. Breaking up the complex concepts into smaller parts, to let the Ss experiment, discuss, discover, build up the theory was particularly interesting, I also thought. Small groups were used, which is a plus. The interactive and constructive tasks, geared towards the production of a formative-assessable product, were important too, and active participation of all members of the class seemed to be at the heart of the lesson(s)."
"The WISE online tool is effective to engage students in different activities and particularly the most effective ones are online lab demonstrations, quizzes, and explanations for the activities."
"Simulation helps students a lot, and the fact that WISE proyect encoraged students to investigate, measure and think possible explanations make them active and main actors of their learnings"
"It seemed as if the students were asked about a concept and then used visuals and demonstrations to aide their understanding. For example, instead of just telling students that metal heats faster than glass, like might be done in a typical textbook, the students controlled the demonstration, giving them time to develop their own hypothesis as they did it. Giving students control of the demonstrations allows them to pace it to their understanding. They can stop and think if needed, or redo it, or move on when they are ready. "
"In my point of view, the WISE  activity can give students the opportunity to experience themselves the lesson , so that they can understand more clearly. Besides, that one also help to encourage them investigate, think and measure which  is great help for students to learn the topics. All thing considered, it can be said that WISE activity is wise learning method for students to learn and apply in practise."
"The WISE platform permits that students interactive with the each topic with drawings, experiments, questions that they have to asnwer in class.   Some students can learn only reading, other needs to fill the experience and this system is better."
"Students worked individually at a pace that allowed them to make predictions and test them, providing individualized understanding of concepts. A range of approaches that are visual and the teacher can monitor and provide feedback."
"during the subject knowledge. it was easy to go ahead with wise platform .  I noticed during the explanation of the Thermodynamics in the kitchen- from WISE project students guided by a web-based system. To reflect on various scenarios , collaborate with partners and  to make test their predictions."
"The demostrations she did to students with the WISE activity, breaking down concepts\r\ninto very small, manageable pieces,  helping students to build ideas up for an easier comprehension\r\n"
"I think the visual simulations of how heat moves through an iron rod,( then the chocolate chips melt more quickly) or another rod made of some other substance made the 'connect' for the visual learners and was more meaningful. It was easier to understand how heat travels through a substance and why our finger feels hotter or colder when one watched these animated diagrams."
"WISE projects engage students in the methods of real scientists. Through various activities and scaffolding tools, students collaborate to explore issues of social importance; they pose relevant questions and make predictions; they experiment with computational models; they work to evaluate and distinguish discrepant information; and they construct evidence-based explanations through reflection and discussion. From WISE's inquiry-based projects, students not only learn skills that prepare them to be successful in science, they also learn skills necessary to be responsible, critical thinking citizens."
"The WISE learning tool allows an instructor to pose to the class questions that probe for conceptual understanding and supports a variety of student response types including: multiple choice answers, multiple choice with short answer follow-up, numerical answers, short answers, and Likert scale surveys."
videos and collaboration activities which make learning more interactive and relevant
The simulations and the practical sessions where students would actually embark on touching items to reflect their understanding.
"thinks ,investigate and measure about the possible explanation conduction, convection, and radiation.\r\nAnd while the students loved my demonstrations,\r\nI actually realized, once we started the WISE activity, that they really\r\ndidn't understand these concepts, even though they enjoyed the nice visuals"
"Touch, feel, observe for yourself was very important. They were moving around the room independently to gather information."
It was student directed with a significant amount of interactive learning engagements that were connected to real world learning. 
I think the visualizations and experimentation aspects of the activity were probably the most effective in helping the students to learn the topics.
"i think the idea of demonstrating the lesson in such an enjoyable funny way that make students predict and see the results of their prediction and compare it with each other in a real life experiment this way gives the students different ideas that broaden their way of thinking also,investigating to find the right answers on their own."
Jennifer used web based system and she used in the kitchen . Metal bowl and wooden bowl .
well i think providing students with meaningful understanding of communication styles will allow them communicate effectively and then collaborate at the level which would allow them to produce tangible results.
"The WISE platform allowed students to create their own knowledge based on what they already knew on the topic. The interactive visuals and the simulations helped students to clarify their ideas. Also, the activities seemed to be presented in a way that each activity builds on the previous."
The opportunity for kids to predict and guess a little bit about the topic. 
WISE can work with students in pairs or alone. Thermodynamics experiments that are difficult to explain the students can learn with experiments and using different materials.  WISE can help to compare and predict each    topic 
"The most important aspects of the WISE activity that I think were most effective , in terms of helping students learn the topics are:\r\nstudents can reflect, cooperate and interact with each other, sth that is engaging and brings good results\r\nthe lessons can be scaffolded which means that students are able to learn things deeply "
"I think the fact they have time to work in groups and fill in, research the topics without teachers input gave them chance to actually learn it. They had to choose the appropriate content by themselves which gave them chance to review material available and learn from it. "
I did not know the WISE but found it excellent because it allows you to check the materials simulation process and experience that it is often impossible to provide in school.
"In contrast with just watching a video, a simulation where the students are able to explore by their own, developing hypothesis and observing the results, is more effective in consolidating their knowledge about the topic."
"Breaking down the concept into smaller parts and then building them up into a coherent understanding was a very effective method to teach a complicated concept. In addition, the simulations of heat flow helped them to visualize the concept. Most importantly, the students did their own investigations. They did the measuring, made predictions, and thought about possible explanations. WISE also provided scaffolding/structure to the learning experience."
Simulations to visually demonstrate the concepts and formative -assessment questions to check up the students' understanding 
"integration of offline and online learning system. Students were not learning only on WISE , they were experimenting in the classroom also. "
Problem and Concept based teaching.\r\nTeaching should try to mold the student behaviour according to the learning objectives.
Students experiencing things that are in your everyday  and you can motivate them to experiment with this subject outside of class
It is inquiry based learning\r\nAllows to develop and navigate to enhance both side of learning\r\nIndulges in critique and feedback\r\nIntelligent question formulation and challenge
"WISE activity gives students a whole picture of how things doing, instead of trying so hard to picture the concept inside their mind. The activity also keeps students' assignments in track and it encourages students to participate and collaborate with their peers during the learning process.\r\n "
one technology in play then tetcher need to eqpemne ting and reflcting and they need professional lkearning for suppot 
"Through it, you have access to online class preparation activities, online homework, online spare lessons, video classes to review the content studied in class, plus hundreds of activities updated daily by our partners and content teams, BUT DYNAMISM AND ACTIVITIES UPDATE MODERN, iS WHAT STUDENTS WANT ALL DAY, CRIATICVAS ACTIVITIES and play!\r\n"
"Students had the opportunity to to while doing.  Students had the opportunity to experiment, investigate, measure, and think which is a good way to make it interesting and keep the student engaged.\r\n"
Students actually get to interact with the materials and content through a web-based digital learning environment. Jennifer was able to use WISE to scaffold their learning through the use of visuals and inquiry-based questions.
while teaching the topic with help of power point presentation we can have pause in the middle of the slide and can ask question to the students to make it more interactive  and effective way of communication.
"simulators, assessment questions, dividing the knowledge into small pieces, putting a problem in front of the students & ask them to solve"
Starting with small conceptual chunks and slowly assembling those into bigger frameworks of understanding.
I think the demonstrations students had access to provided them with interesting expierences on the topic. 
The aspects i think are most effective are;\r\n- the use of stimulations to compare how fast heat will flow through the different materials such as wood and metal.\r\n- touching of various materials in the classroom to test their prediction of their temperatures.
The important thing is that students become researchers and knowledge is built step by step.
The simulations and students' ability to work on the computer independently and collectively. The teacher's ability to assess students and customize the online lesson.
"With WISE was possible to notice the interest among students, the dynamics and the comprees£o on the content. Through it, it was possible to identify that students were getting the theory and then checking in practice what they were learning.It was an incredible experience."
That they have a page by page guideline of what to do. Lots of times my students try jumping ahead and they lose out on the scaffolding. 
The research work through the simulation provided by the web system and the activities in which the teacher has to observe every idea participation of students.
"I think the simulation function and predict test will help students to get the understanding quite effective, because if teachers run the experiment it will need a lot of safe guide training time for students."
"ne of the initial goals of the Forum (username: csi; password: wise) was to examine wise practice characteristics, which had been developed by the participants in the workshop on Towards wise coastal development practiceÈ held in Paris in 1998, through the presentation of specific case studies (example wise practices) in which the characteristics were to be used to analyse the case studies.  (The list of characteristics and their definitions, as agreed by the participants in the December 1998 workshop, and as revised following this analysis, is included in Appendix II).  Through this process, the usefulness of these characteristics as a means to help identify wise practices could be determined.  Thus the idea was to go back to the field level, to the grassroots level, and look at the characteristics in a critical and case-specific light.  "
"Firstly, it can demonstrate picturesvideosmotions which can give a vivid image of studying materials to students, thus help them to master abstract concepts. Secondly, the WISE can put up assessment beforeduring and after the learning process which reveals the students' thoughts about the questions and provoke their deeper thinking, meanwhile, it's convenient for the teachers to get a better understanding of the students's learning. Thirdly, using WISE,the students can collaborate with their peers and teachers more efficiently."
"Students can create their own piece of work, adding videos, photos, write it and share it online. Teacher can help giving their hints but they are the agents in this process."
not teaching any students
discussion and teaching new modality and techniques to the learning students 
"Formative assessment is where the teacher\r\nlearns something about what the student knows,\r\nnot as a way of evaluating the outcome of the instruction,\r\nbut as a means of further tailoring instruction that responds"
"Some of the most effective aspects of WISE platform is the capacity to approach the content of a subject, for instance a unit and the teacher to be able to develop a coherent distribution of activities in order to understand that particular concept. So this activities are simulations, explanations, predicctions etc. There are different way to explain a concept, also when students bring preconceived ideas to this concepts. Feedback it is very important and valuable in this WISE activity, as well it offers activities to work with others."
"I like that the students were encouraged to make their own prediction on the way and how  heat is conducted through different material. Also the hands on experience of making inquiry, this way they were able to collaborate and share their findings."
"In this activity, students could visualise the different changes an item was under going when in contact with other item. This would not have been possible in a classroom via only the lecture method."
"Students work in groups, they experiment, discuss and reach decisions collaboratively."
"I think the most effective aspects ot the WISE activity were, first of all, the fact that it has helped students undrstand a difficult topic by diving it into small sections, making it understandable for them. Secondly, this activity has encouraged collaboration between students and has given them the opportunity to think carefully with their head and verify their hypothesis."
That may be very helpful using WISE.
"allowing for collaborate with partners and to make and test their predictions, "
I believe that listening to what they think and how they are evolving during the learning process. 
It seems breaking down the content into smaller pieces and then building on those pieces was particularly useful. Also the range of simulations was helpful.
Engage all students with tools that they  grow up in this age of technology \r\nEncourage thinking and participation \r\nLearn by doing and visualisation
It allowed students to see the phenomena about thermodinamics.  They could see how stuff works in simulations.
"Help students to get a better vision of what  it is been taught, as for thermodynamics lecture, for instance, it is easier to demonstrate the heat  produced by the finger when approached to a metal. The design of the lesson is more effectively conducted with the use of the WISE."
"In chronic recurrent sialadenitis or chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, acute attacks are managed with conservative therapies such as hydration, analgesics (mainly NSAIDs), sialogogues to stimulate salivary secretion, and regular, gentle gland massage.[1] If infection is present, appropriate cultures should be obtained, followed by empirical antibiotic therapy initially,[1] for example amoxicillin/clavulanate or clindamycin which cover oral flora.\r\n\r\nIf there are attacks more than approximately 3 times per year or severe attacks, surgical excision of the affected gland should be considered.[1]"
Practical examples using excellent visuals. Challenges and questions that the students could investigate for themselves.
