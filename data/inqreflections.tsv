The fact that so many learning tools, activities and ideas can be carried out with a programme such as WISE, means that there is more of a chance for differentiation to take place among the different learners.

She was there to explain the activity, introduce the topic and then act as a guide for the students as they made their own way through the activity. This leads to learner autonomy and independence as the students do not fully depend on the teacher.

In fact, they learn to depend on their own understanding of the use of technology itself and of the content or topic involved. b) Some new opportunities that came about were peer collaboration. The activity allowed for students to work together. One of the criticisms of using technology in eduction is that the students are using computers and not socialising. This activity is to the contrary. It allows students to collaborate in a meaningful way and learn from each other, as well as communicate on a personal level, while using tachnology for learning. As I mentioned above, the lesson allows for differentitation among learners as the varying activities and scenarios they are exposed to can appeal to different learners. It alos allows for the teacher to give individual attention to those who may find the topic difficult. In a traditional classroom environment, this can be difficult as all students are focused on the teacher. However, as all students are engaged in their own work here, the teacher is freer to move around and check in as a guide for individuals or groups. The teacher can clearly keep track of what students are doing and learning, and each student can ome up with ideas. This again allows each student to become more involved in the learning process.

I always plan backwards and design a set of success criteria for the students which wll enable me to evaluate if they have reach their learning objectives and also so they have a clear vision of what they are expected to achieve taking into account where each student is at at the beggining. Another similarity is that I prefer not to teach scientific laws outright but design activities which help studentsto  prepdict laws. An example of this is when my students used light rays and mirrors to discover the law of reflection. I feel that students have a better understanding of these laws when they see them in action first. It also allows them to reflect on the variables in their results and allows them to come up with reasons why different groups observe different things. \\r\\n\\r\\nI also like to use pair share to help students deepen their learning. Comparing and contrasting their notes, observtions and ideas helps students  to correct misconceptions without suffering the stress factor of being wrong in front of the whole class. Often students listen more attentively to each other than they do to the teacher. \\r\\n\\r\\nConcepts  should be applied as often as possible otherwise  they don't develop into learning. I nearly always get students to apply their learning in a hands on way such as making ciruits, using the scientific method or designing systems which they can use to solve a problem. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs shawn, I try to use assessment as part of the everyday class routine and if I discover problems then I try and solve them by returning to the concept but looking at if from another angle. I completely agree with what he says about groups that suprise you with their concpetual hiccoughs, i think teachers have taken too many things for granted for too long and our teaching will be a lot more effective if you use assessment for learning on a daily basis. \\r\\n\\r\\nDifferences \\r\\n\\r\\nI have never use Nearpod in class and it seems to me to be an extremely useful tool. Usually when I assess the starting point of the students i use a quiz or a some kind of team challenge which helps the students delve into the memories and drag up thier previous learning. I try not to give homework as I believe that students spend enough time in school. What I do try and encourage them to do is apply skills learnt in school in their everyday life. I encourage them to be active in poltical deabate or matters of local ecology or to play music or whatever it is that they love to do with their free time.   "", ""2"": ""The greatest challenge is to capture student's attention and provide them with a motivating, big question to go after. Of course in all classes there are many different interests and it is hard to get the wow factor always with all students. I find that choosing important and motivating issues helps though. For example in Minorca, where I live, there is a big problem with nitrates in the water. The students were asked to design systems which could be used to water plants with sea water. In groups students made their systems and everybody tried to grow a plant. In this topic we covered lots of concepts such as evaporation points, condensation, solutions, seperating mixtures. We also covered other enormous issues such as civic responisiblity, collecting data form external sources to support an argument as well as debating the root causes of the problems that exist here. If I had lectured them on this problem, they would have been asleep in 10 mins. \\r\\n\\r\\n Although the students had very different starting points and at first they thought the topic boring, they were soon investigating, designing and making predicitons. They were also told from the beginning through the use of success critieria that it didn't matter if their system didn't work, what counted in the evaluation was that they were expected to identify problems and try to solve them. I think supporting students to realize that they can learn from their mistakes is indeed a challenge as, at least here in Spain, they are so used to being punished for making mistakes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe group work factor is a big challenge for me making sure that everybody participates and that there are no students who are just along for the ride. I get students to evaluate each other contributions, I also design roles so that everybody is responsible for something, however there are always problems. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf students are not used to these kind of enquiry lessons then some training is needed. Often as teachers, we think up what we consider to be 'great ideas' and expect our students to have all the skills necessary to carry out our wonderful lesson plans. Often they don't have those skills and everybody ends up frustrated. I think that part of the backward plannning method needs to include small, simple sessions throughout the year in which students can hone the skills we want them to use.

As a visual arts teacher,  he uses inquiry in class  to develop a creative process which is composed of many stages,including feedback, revisions, and reflections. During this process students  challenge  complex artistic problems which require students to continually evaluate their choice of material,\\r\\ntechnique, and design strategy, and to continually make qualitative judgments about the relationships between form, content and context.  Collaboration is central to this process because  it helps a young artist recognize strengths\\r\\nand weaknesses in a suggested design.  Students engage in peer feedback and by responding to each other's proposals, or jottings.Students get feedback by talking over their projects in class.  In addition Charlie used technology to facilitate discussion on contemporary approach to artistic design.

I agree with Maria that the group sizes for her projects were too large.  I have encountered this problem as well and I find that students work the best in group sizes of 3-4.

How many times have you had something to contribute to a discussion only to have someone else change the direction?  Being able to contribute multiple ideas at the same time propels problem solving and critical thinking forward in a way that forces students to remain engaged in learning.

But what the teenager? And the child? Parents, students and professionals from academia and other professionals for the education of our children today live a major concern: the need for technical preparation due to strong presence of technology in our lives, whether in shopping malls, banks, in homes and especially in schools. Do all people effectively, are prepared for the implementation of technology in education?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor us locate some more, let's see what would be technology. Goodman & Sproull (1990) define technology as the knowledge of cause-effect relationships contained (embedded) in machinery and equipment used to perform a service or manufacture a product. Word for lay users, technology means the particular set of devices, machines and other equipment used in the company for the production of its results.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Fleury (1990), a very different approach sees technology as a packet of information organized in various types from various sources and obtained through various methods used in the production of goods.\\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Goní_alves Lima (1994) technology is much more than just equipment, machinery and computers. The organization runs from the two operation systems that depend on one another variously. There is a technical system, formed by the techniques and tools and used to perform each task. There is also a social system to your needs, expectations and feelings about work. Both systems are simultaneously optimized when the requirements of technology and people's needs are met together. Thus, it is possible to distinguish between technology (knowledge) and technical system (specific combination of machines and methods employed to achieve a desired result).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this case, we can conclude that the technology would be represented by a set of specific characteristics of the technical system in the scenario in which it operates. We can then define briefly what would be technology, as any product created input or else innovated, and that by the way has its proper market, represented by the use of needs in the medium in which it is inserted.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear, therefore, the use of new technologies by the individual in the organization, where the factor prerequisite own, is in school (education) that we must prepare ourselves, that is, that is when we have the chance to obtain knowledge and wisdom in order to be prepared for the future invested in the labor market, but when this could happen? Even as a child?\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing some principles of Piaget (1975), we see that for example in the case of children, they must have a certain time suitable to enjoy their childhood, have an ideal period for entry into school and start from there to be literate, or whether the child should achieve and obtain a certain minimum degree of maturity to then yes engage with more responsible assignments. We know, indeed, that simply because a child look and manipulate a computer, you can take it to have an impact at first, leading in some cases to change the psychological framework, since treatment is done with the machine through a mechanistic and artificial process and not through the relationship with other human beings. We care to propose and implement all feasible technical and hitherto known traditional learning with children, aiming to influence your imagination, motor skills and creativity as we always have. But what the computer, we should use it?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe live in an era of emphasis on information such as the presence of magazines, TV news and the Internet, where one must be always informed. But it is important to remember that information is not knowledge. Knowledge involves establishing relations between isolated information. If we think in this sense, much of what is called the school knowledge is information only and disconnected: empty concepts, to be stored and forgotten. Information is disposable, just not to have ties or with other information, nor knowledge, but above all for not having her emotional ties, War (2001).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we know, computer (hardware) is only able to process data, but in logic level (software) can work with information, text editing, automating processes, from the fundamentals brought about by information theory, we can sketch the following flow of knowledge and wisdom:\\r\\nGoogle Tradutor para empresas:Google Toolkit de traduí_í£o para appsTradutor de sitesGlobal Market Finder\\r\\nDesativar traduí_í£o instantí¢neaSobre o Google TradutorCelularComunidadePrivacidade e TermosAjudaEnviar feedback\\r\\n""}"5	"{""1"": ""Projects or tasks where they can research on the topics and collaborate together to review the content where all benefit from the goup work.

However, there were several students, who were either not interested in learning\\r\\n English or had problem in listening, lagged behind the lesson. The strategies employed \\r\\nwere to use visual and sign language. Play based learning, such as the fruit salad\\r\\n game, run and fetch, and musical chairs were important elements in any lesson. During the \\r\\nactivities, I usually assigned a buddy system. To end the lesson, I usually played jeopardy to \\r\\nincrease higher level thinking. \\r\\n\\r\\nCollege promotes differentiation. I recall the motivational speech of  Dr.Gordon Greavette, chair\\r\\n of Liberal Studies at Conestoga College, elaborated on how to use instructional differentiation, \\r\\nincluding small groups, peer coaches, assessment for learning and learning styles for a \\r\\nmulticultural class. He uses the Radical Wellness framework to encourage students and faculty\\r\\nto follow their passion in special education and meaningful experiences. During my recent visit \\r\\nwith School of English, I observed they used differentiation in a multiple of ways. When \\r\\nstudents are struggling in class, the professors are always there for help and act as a counsellor as \\r\\nwell.  The professors designed well organized curriculum to create success learning criteria and \\r\\nensure no students are left behind. \\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers, including Professor Hutchinson and Professor Wooley emphasize the importance of \\r\\ndifferentiation in teaching. The guidelines in Education for All provide a good insight for \\r\\nOntario teachers and are valuable to young teachers like us. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n"", ""2"": ""I usually provide clear instructions and make sure use the curriculum guidelines as a starting point.

Fostering a culturally inclusive learning environment encourages all individuals äóñ regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation or political beliefs äóñ to develop personal contacts and effective intercultural skills. I do not have a class at the moment as I am a displaced teacher. In reference to a class that I assist there is a mixture of Australian, Vietnamese and Cambodian students. There are also five autistic children in the classroom.\\r\\nThe online format of the Australian Curriculum provides flexibility in how the curriculum can be viewed: by learning area, by multiple year levels or by year level across learning areas. The curriculum may also be filtered to show where general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities are embedded in learning area content. While the general capabilities and crosscurriculum priorities are embedded in learning area content descriptions, they can also be viewed separately. These key elements and functions are demonstrated in a guided tour located on the Australian Curriculum homepage. The general capabilities are organised in continua of learning that typically, but not exclusively, align with years of schooling. As such, each level in the general capability learning continuum is labelled with: ¥‰‡ a heading from Level 1 to Level 6 to emphasise that it presents a sequence of learning independent of student age ¥‰‡ an accompanying statement that the level typically applies to students by the end of a given year of schooling to show the relationship with learning area content descriptions. The three-dimensional design of the Australian Curriculum, comprising learning areas, general capabilities and cross-curriculum priorities, provides teachers with flexibility to cater for student diversity and to personalise learning through curriculum adjustments. Teachers can help meet individual learning needs by emphasising one or more of the three dimensions of the curriculum. They can incorporate specific teaching of the general capabilities or cross-curriculum priorities through the learning area content (for example, teaching targeted literacy skills through a history lesson or providing opportunities to explore sustainability in a science lesson). \\r\\nThe above system is what the Australian teachers teach to.   Cooperative learning and inquiry-based teaching yield big dividends to take alternative perspectives to better appreciate cultural diversity."", ""2"": "" Student engagement can be promoted in the following ways:\\r\\n1. Enhance studentsäó» self-belief \\r\\n2. Enable students to work autonomously, enjoy learning relationships with others, and feel they are competent to achieve their own objectives \\r\\n3.

When teachers know how to measuretheir studentsäó» level of engagement, teachers then need to  increase the amount of time that students in their class are engaged in teacher's instruction? Here are some suggestions:\\r\\nUse the 10:2 method. For every 10 minutes of instruction allow the students 2 minutes to process and respond to the instruction. This can be done in various ways by having them write what they have learned, questions they may have, or by discussing the content with a fellow student.\\r\\n2.Incorporate movement into your lessons. Require students to respond to a question by moving to a certain spot in the room, writing on whiteboards, or standing (or sitting) when they are done thinking about the question, etc.\\r\\n3.Pick up the pace. One misconception is that we must go slow for students to really understand and engage in a lesson. There is a lot of evidence that shows that when teaching is at a brisk instructional pace, students have more opportunities to engage, respond, and move on to the next concept (Carnine & Fink, 1978; Williams, 1993; Ernsbarger et al., 2001).\\r\\n4.Provide frequent and effective feedback.\\r\\n5.Allow students 5-7 seconds of äóÖthink timeäó» when asking a question. At the end of the time draw a random name to answer the question.\\r\\n6.At the end of a lesson have students use the 3-2-1 method of summarizing by having students record three things they learned, two interesting things, and one question they have about what was taught. Allow time to share their findings with a peer.\\r\\n7.Periodically pause mid-sentence when teaching requiring students to fill in the blanks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n""}"6	"{""1"": "".

For instance, if it is noticed that some students choose to simply agree or disagree with other responses, encourage those students to explain why they agree or disagree and eventually introduce them to another way of contributing (e.g., asking for clarification). \\r\\nConversely, students who tend to see only the big picture at times need reminders to clarify their intent and statements in a way that makes sense to all students."", ""2"": ""Moving students beyond initial curiosity to a path of regular inquiry is one of the great \\r\\nchallenges of inquiry-based learning.

It is often difficult for teachers to know if middle school and high school students cannot or will not do the assignments; often all they know is that students do not do them. Herein lies the challenge for teachers and administrators: how to motivate middle and high school students to read and write so that they engage in literacy tasks and are willing to accept instruction and take advantage of opportunities to practice and accept feedback, thereby improving their academic literacy skills that will, in turn, improve their content-area learning and achievement.\\r\\nThis is not an either/or proposition. Instruction without attention to motivation is useless, especially in the case of students who are reluctant to read and write in the first place. As Kamil (2003) points out, äóìMotivation and engagement are critical for adolescent readers. If students are not motivated to read, research shows that they will simply not benefit from reading instructionäóù (p. 8). In other words, adolescents will take on the task of learning how to read (or write) better only if they have sufficiently compelling reasons for doing so.\\r\\nBecause motivation leads to engagement, motivation is where teachers need to begin. Reading and writing, just like anything else, require an investment by the learner to improve. As humans, we are motivated to engage when we are interested or have real purpose for doing so. So motivation to engage is the first step on the road to improving literacy habits and skills. Understanding adolescents' needs for choice, autonomy, purpose, voice, competence, encouragement, and acceptance can provide insight into some of the conditions needed to get students involved with academic literacy tasks. Most successful teachers of adolescents understand that meeting these needs is important when developing good working relationships with their students. However, many teachers have not thought of these needs in relation to their potential consequences for literacy development, that is, to what extent they meet these needs in the classroom through the academic literacy tasks they assign and the literacy expectations they have for students.\\r\\nMotivating students is importantäóîwithout it, teachers have no point of entry. But it is engagement that is critical, because the level of engagement over time is the vehicle through which classroom instruction influences student outcomes. For example, engagement with reading is directly related to reading achievement (Guthrie, 2001; Guthrie & Wigfield, 2000). Engagementäóîwith sports, hobbies, work, or readingäóîresults in opportunities to practice. Practice provides the opportunity to build skills and gain confidence.\\r\\nHowever, practicing without feedback and coaching often leads to poor habits. Coachingäóîor, in this case, explicit teachingäóîhelps refine practice, generates feedback, creates structured exercises targeted to specific needs, and provides encouragement and direction through a partnership with the learner. Note that more modeling, structure, and encouragement are often needed to engage students who are motivated to begin but who have weaker skills and therefore may not have the ability or stamina to complete tasks on their own.""}"6	"{""1"": ""There are mostly language ability differences, areas of interest differences and background knowledge differences.\\r\\nInquiry lesson really helps learners explore the areas of lessons according to their level of ability.
