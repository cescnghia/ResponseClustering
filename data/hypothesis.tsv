I really like this concept and application of SNA with integration of critical discourse analysis (CDA), which is a course I am taking in the fall!! In another class, we read about critical quantitative approach, and I now think what makes it truly critical might be the integration of a mixed method approach, where something like ethnographic case studies or in this case discourse analysis is used in combination with SNA/statistical analyses to give it more robust findings.

Throughout the semester, I have struggled with turning my research topic into a researchable question. I think I've come up with some decent questions, but I'm constantly rewording them.	 First, start with an initial topic of interest and then turn this topic into a question. 	Looking Back, Looking Ahead - SAGE Research Methods
Due to classroom size, I am very limited here with what I could use for complete networks and I'm concerned with the small sample size that the combined quantitative analysis will not show statistical significance

A question I have had for awhile relates to the timeframe for developing a theoretical framework, and how to present that experience in a manuscript. It seems to be a good idea to understand a theoretical framework well after consulting the literature before collecting data. Often enough, I suppose data will not match the theoretical framework, which may force an adjustment of somesort. How do you present this in a manuscript? This experience may lead to the richest conclusions, but I could see authors writing to different audiences and varying their emphasis on the theoretical shift.	it is critical that you immerse yourself in the relevant literature that has developed and tested various components related to these and other network-based theories.

Since no one had "done" what I was looking to do I also found it helpful to look for studies that had the same general goal as mine. Even if we were talking about departments in a huge corporation or different professional development groups and how they shared knowledge it was pretty easy to find things in common with my own information.

This is certainly applicable to my own study.  My original thought was that my data could be undirected, but I'm now questioning that.  For example, it would be interesting to see if an initial contact between two students was then reciprocated, or if there were other contacts that seemed to follow from the initial. 	If you are observing faculty members in a teachers’ lounge, are you interested in who speaks with whom, or are you also interested in who initiated the conversation?

I'm not looking for causality in my study; it's more exploratiional and inductive than that.  I imagine this is driven in part by my personal usage of SNA as a tool within a study, as opposed to being the methodology of a study in and of itself.

I don't have a large network, but am I working with more complex data.  Not super complex, but I like the idea of the integration it describes.

I used something similar to this for coding SP and CP, which was much more meaningful for me than just binary ties.  However, I'm running into issues in graphing these because SP has 3 valued elements to graph.  	Valued data reflect the relative strength, frequency, or duration of a relationship between a pair of actors.

I collected all the data!  Because I may be using this for multiple studies, I collected everything on a weekly basis (after the close the discussion forum for the week).

Continuation from previous post...

I can see, however, that I either need to be doing the incredibly tedious thing of coding in one session, double checking coding, and/or having a more detailed rubric to follow. Because what I was applying was not totally clearcut, I can see where I may have (and probably did) code similar things differently when it came to levels of CP and SP. Not ideal, but also helpful for ensuring better consistency in future studies	 validity, reliability, accuracy, and patterns of missingness	Looking Back, Looking Ahead - SAGE Research Methods
I was beginning to think my answers to everything was going to be "Could've done that better...," but this was one area I did pretty well.  It was more of a given, since I was teaching the class.  In future studies, I could look at pairing with another instructor.  That might make my coding of things like CP and SP more objective.  I found myself sometimes downgrading one student whose posts were at a higher CP level because I wasn't used to them doing that level of CP in their work.  I had to go back a few times to compare coding.  Triangulation in the form of another coder would be helpful, but I think objectivity would help too.  It's hard to do study not your own class though, given access issues.	Select a Sample	Looking Back, Looking Ahead - SAGE Research Methods

As Bodong knows all too well, my issue is in narrowing.  I have way too many research questions currently because I'm trying to work too many elements together.  I could do a better job of isolating elements rather than trying to find some grand way they all fit together.  Just because they're related doesn't mean they belong in the same study.

I had done some review of the lit before taking this course, but I didn't understand SNA well enough to "get" the studies.  Other studies I've pulled have happened after my own research began.  If I were doing this process again, I would do a better job in this first step of reviewing before formulating.  I would also be a little more inclusive--there are not as many studies for SNA and CoI together (so great niche to publish in, but for lit review, I should cast a wider net).	This should happen even before you start formulating your own research questions.	Looking Back, Looking Ahead - SAGE Research Methods
Area for improvement in my project	art III introduced two of these theoretical areas (social capital and diffusion of innovation), but there are many others. These others include network exchange theory (Blau, 1964; Cook, Emerson, Gilmore, & Yamagishi, 1983), which focuses on how a network's structure influences whom in the network emerges as powerful, and social influence theory (e.g., Friedkin, 1998), which considers how actors influence one another's thoughts.

They provide a base for comparison similar to a control group?	ERGMs are the primary building blocks of statistically testing network structural effects. Increasingly, researchers are not only interested in describing an ego or complete network but rather in whether an observed network property is significant. ERGMs [Page 179]generate (random) networks derived from features of the observed network, which provide a way to compare the observed and simulated networks. Statistical analysis is then conducted to test whether the ties in the simulated network match those generated by the simulations.

This makes a connection to my prior knowledge about traditional statistics, binary Logistic regression(dependent variable is binary, 0 or 1) and multiple Logistic regression(dependent variable has multiple levels, just like the school leader network example, four possible outcomes).

I know that normality does not matter for SNA, but is this particular section referring to a nonparametric test that works like a t-test or is it actually referring to the use of a t-test and just ignoring the assumption of normality?	This hypothesis can be tested by comparing the average out-degree (number of dichotomized collaboration ties sent) of district- and school-level leaders.

Oy.  This (multiple linear regression) is much harder for me to wrap my brain around, but I'm going to give it a go (especially since I have so many variables and it might be useful for tying them together).

How well does a student's perceived sense of belonging predict his/her level of CP in discussion posts, controlling for discussion forum type (for example, only looking at large group discussions)?  That doesn't get the SP in there though, and may not actually be a great model of regression. :/  Help?	How well does a leader's perceived level of trust in his or her colleagues predict the number of alters to whom the person sent a collaboration tie in year 1, controlling for gender and the level at which the person works (district vs. school)?

when reading this, I don't know why but a question suddenly came into my mind, why do we need so complicated/fancy models in social science research, specifically, except core independent variables and outcome variables, why do we use covariate/ control variables in a given model. I had an insight from a professor's explanation: for natural science, most objects of study are homogeneous and  scientists can have a good control of interference in lab environment with careful experimental design. However, in terms of social science phenomenons, they are so complicated and are impacted by so many factors, including which we already know, and also  a lot of which we don't know yet, let alone the subjects of social science study are so unique and heterogeneous. So we have to use advanced model to get closer to understanding those complex phenomenons, and we have to try our best to control the covariates we already know to carefully test the real relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. In addition, because we can not know or measure all factors that will impact a certain complex phenomenon, this is one of the reasons that a model is a simplification or  approximation of reality and hence will not reflect all of reality.

Again, if I were to try to apply this (p*) to my own data, I could look at things like gender, race, etc, but it would make more sense to see if SP was tied in--in other words, take the same scenario from p1 (if a student respond to another (say, in a large group discussion), is that student more likely to respond back when higher levels of SP are involved?  I *think* I applied that correctly. 	P* models are often employed to take this further by including actor- and network-level covariates. 	Network Data and Statistical Models - SAGE Research Methods
Again, attempting to apply to my own study.  This one (p1)seems straightforward.  If one student responds to another (in a large group discussion), is the other student more likely to reciprocate by responding to that student in future discussions?	Using directed and dichotomized relational data, a p1 model can be used, for example, to test whether school leaders tend to reciprocate relationship choices.	Network Data and Statistical Models - SAGE Research Methods
I have next to no stats knowledge, so I'm going to try to extrapolate this out in regards to my own research to try to better understand it (hopefully!).  In using my own research with SP (social presence) and CP (cognitive presence).  I'm going to start with the varibles:  levels of SP, levels of CP, discussion forum type.  A question I have been asking is whether discussion forum type affects SP and/or CP.  Modeling the question the same way as this one, it might be whether students are more likely to show higher CP with students they were in a programmatic small group discussion with versus just large group.  I *think* this models this line of questioning, at least.  This probably doesn't get the SNA part in.  So, trying again... Are students more likely to respond to a student in a large group discussion that they formed a connection with in a programmatic small group discussion or a random small group discussion?  This doesn't get the SP or CP working in there, but it gets the SNA.  So part of what I'm studying.  But, since I'm graphing SP as a weighted measure for SNA, maybe it could be whether students are more likely to demonstrate higher SP in an ensuing large-group discussion with students they were in small programmatic group discussion with in a previous module.  Does that get all the parts working approporiately in a MR-QAP-procedure question??	The question, therefore, is whether school leaders prefer to collaborate with those with whom they have collaborated in the past or with those that they have turned to discuss confidential issues. 	Network Data and Statistical Models - SAGE Research Methods
a good conclusion, and I will keep this in mind while going through next chapter.	While these approaches are varied and perhaps even complicated, the key is that they are predicated on the idea of comparing an observed network property to a whole bunch of simulated networks.

This sentences articulates the key character of statistics, I like it. 	Where statistics really become “statistical” is on the inferential side, that is, when attention turns to assessing the reproducibility or likelihood of an observed pattern	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
This sentence answers a question I proposed a few weeks ago.	there is little apparent difference between conventional statistical approaches and network approaches 	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
Since my own study takes these measures weekly, I'm curious to see how the statistical aspect may help draw connections between weeks and predict what could happen in future weeks.  

Although, I will say I think this is only true in a broad sense.  For example, I think I may be able to predict from a couple weeks of SNA data who the central players in future weeks will be (rock star students tend to retain that status throughout), but it may not be able to predict who responds to whom.  Though such a measure may not be all that useful anyway.

Coming back to this after reading the chapter, I'm having a difficult time deciding whether statistical approaches make sense for me.  I am trying to make generalizations, but it's not around categories (like gender, race, etc.).  Unless maybe my category is SP (social presence)?  To make a prediction about students with high SP having high CP (cognitive presence)?
	These measures convey the image of a fixed network with attitudes or behaviors passing through it,	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
Mathematical is descriptive (centrality, degree, etc), whereas statistical is inferative (allowing to make a prediction about the network).  A researcher would be interested in the former if they do not need to make generlatizations about their network--if they are just interested in their network for its own sake.  If the researcher wanted to say something about the population in general based on their network, then they would want to consider integrating statistical approaches.	Contrast the aims of the mathematical and statistical approaches to social network analysis. For what reasons would educational researchers prefer one approach versus the other?	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
If your network differs from a typical random creation, then you can perhaps make a claim about unique properties.	Explain in plain language how simulations are used to create a probability distribution that enables you to make a statistical inference with network data.	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
Simulations make things a lot easier.  In even a modestly sized network, there could be thousands of permutations.  Having a tool to create randomizations makes the process much less cumbersome.	Why are these simulations necessary in order to make probabilistic inferences with network data?	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
For my own study, this would be making a claim about the connection of SP to CP in certain discussion forum types to suggest that you can get the biggest bang for your SP and CP buck by adopting a certain discussion forum type.  	According to this emphasis, the main question asked is: If a study is repeated on a different sample (drawn by the same method), how likely is it that you would get the same answer about what is going on in the whole population from which both samples have been drawn? 	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
In terms of my project (looking at racial and gender-based biases in communication between undergarduate students in an online class), then I could use this same rationale and process in order to make generalizations to a broader population? 	So, let's say you are interested in the number of collaborative exchanges that occur between teachers from two different grade levels in a complete network of teachers within one elementary school. First, you count the number of times these types of exchanges occur in the observed network and then permute these relational data lots and lots of times. With each permutation, you calculate the number of times this type of tie (collaborative exchanges between teachers from two different grade levels) occurs and compare this result to the original observed network. After this process of permuting and comparing, you can see how often the results of these permutations are the same as the original observed results: The more often the results of the permutations are the same as your observed data, the more likely that the pattern of exchanges in the observed data was due to chance. If, however, the results from the observed data are so unlikely when compared to the results of the permutations, then you are to conclude that your results are not the byproduct of chance. Therefore, this result would be considered statistically significant.	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
I'm in this category with my own research outside fo this class. 	In many cases, network analysts are studying a particular network or set of networks and have no interest in generalizing to a larger population of such networks (either because there isn't any such population or because they simply do not care about generalizing to it in any probabilistic way)	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods
But didn't this just get done talking about how networks in the real world tend to change and shift?  What would the value of this approach be, then, especially in regards to education research where, by its very nature, networks change often? 	equilibrium” status of the network	An Introduction to Statistical Inference With Network Data - SAGE Research Methods

Comparing different groups with the same or similar structure?  Or differing patterns of interaction within the groups?  Or both?	 Alternately, you would also use an egocentric approach if your research question is about different patterns of interaction within defined groups	Measures for Egocentric Network Analysis - SAGE Research Methods
Given the nature of my data (Forbes top companies), I think it would be appropriate to look at specific countries as the Ego and the job categories as the alters. Am I correct in assuming that the local pattern of relations would be how my selected county (the ego) is connected to other countries through job category?	Egocentric analysis shifts the analytical lens onto a sole ego actor and concentrates on the local pattern of relations in which that ego is embedded as well as the types of resources to which those relations provide access.

Since I am working with countries and job categories, I think it would be best for me to work with non directional neighborhoods. I would like to see some directed ego centric data though.	it is possible to examine directed relations in egocentric network studies, or what are referred to as out- and in-neighborhoods: ties sent or ties received	Measures for Egocentric Network Analysis - SAGE Research Methods
