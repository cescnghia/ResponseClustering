" I think the transition of seeing a visual model demonstrating a scientific concept on-screen to being able to engage in tactile learning (by touching different materials of the same temperature) to immediately apply what you've just seen is extremely effective. It's a perfect way of applying the 'learn by seeing, then doing' principle.\r\n\r\nAs Jennifer stated in the video, the effectiveness of the activity also stems from the fact that initially, concepts are presented in small, manageable chunks and are eventually synthesized to present a coherent bigger picture. I think this is a much more effective way of presenting science topics than the norm, which is to introduce a complex scientific term and concept, and sequentially break it down. Students can initially feel intimidated that way and that fear may color their understanding throughout the lesson.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously, small student groups are always the best way for promoting reflective discussion.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for formative assessment by looking at the WISE teacher's interface without moving around and making students aware of your presence was also a great feature of the activity, allowing Jennifer to pause the lesson at appropriate intervals for a class-level discussion.", i think the transition of seeing a visual model demonstrating a scientific concept on screen to being able to engage in tactile learning  by touching different materials of the same temperature  to immediately apply what you've just seen is extremely effective. it's a perfect way of applying the 'learn by seeing  then doing' principle.    as jennifer stated in the video  the effectiveness of the activity also stems from the fact that initially  concepts are presented in small  manageable chunks and are eventually synthesized to present a coherent bigger picture. i think this is a much more effective way of presenting science topics than the norm  which is to introduce a complex scientific term and concept  and sequentially break it down. students can initially feel intimidated that way and that fear may color their understanding throughout the lesson.    and obviously  small student groups are always the best way for promoting reflective discussion.    opportunities for formative assessment by looking at the wise teacher's interface without moving around and making students aware of your presence was also a great feature of the activity  allowing jennifer to pause the lesson at appropriate intervals for a class level discussion.,think transition see visual model demonstrate scientific concept screen able engage tactile learning touch different material temperature immediately apply see extremely effective perfect way apply learn see principle jennifer state video effectiveness activity also stem fact initially concept present small manageable chunk eventually synthesize present coherent big picture think much effective way present science topic norm introduce complex scientific term concept sequentially break student initially feel intimidate way fear color understanding lesson obviously small student group always best way promote reflective discussion opportunity formative assessment look wise teacher interface move around make student aware presence also great feature activity allow jennifer pause lesson appropriate interval class level discussion

"Jennifer shared a lesson that posed challenges for her grade 7 age students. This is because any discussion of heat requires students to visualize what is occurring at the atomic level. Students in grade 7 are still at the concrete level of learning - that is, it is easiest for them to formulate an explanation of a phenomenon if they can create a model that they can touch or manipulate somehow using their own hands. This is not possible with heat even when a microscope is used.\r\n\r\nAspects of the technology that I thought were effective were:\r\n1. The use of collaborative group work: students of grades 7 through 11 learn best in small groups which challenge students to think together about the data that is presented and make sense of it together.\r\n2. scaffolding learning based on student reflections and measurements- because the data is collected for assessment and the next activity presented is based on a group's or individual's interpretation of data, this helped keep students focused on the lesson goals and their understanding. This gave the teacher a certain amount of flexibility to move around the room and monitor student progress and understanding.\r\n3. The assessment tool allowed collection of data to be used for assessment and/or evaluation. This could be used as either diagnostic or formative assessment. Perhaps it could be used as summative assessment as well?\r\n4. I liked the prediction and reflection boxes for students to record what they thought the temperature of different types of objects in the classroom would be, along with the explanation box. This would allow the teacher to easily assess whether the majority of students understood that every material in the classroom was in fact the same temperature even though cardboard objects would feel warmer than metal ones due to conductance.\r\n5. I liked the function that allowed the teacher to freeze student screens to focus their attention to the front of the room to look at individual student answers and/or data.\r\n6. I liked the aspect of this program that allowed the teacher to easily copy and modify the activity to meet the particular needs and motivations of her cohort.

"The WISE activities are interactive and encourage students to make predictions, this is crucial in supporting critical thinking skills.

This allows the teacher to reflect on the areas in which students are progressing and also identify the concepts which commonly cause difficulties. The teacher can then use further classes to address these conceptul difficulties. \r\n\r\nAnother great teaching tool which the WISE programme provides is the ability to pull out ideas from the studentÎs work and share them on the screen with the class.

"There were many aspects of the WISE activity on thermodynamics that I suspect were very effective in helping students learn the topics.  One aspect was providing students with animations that show what heat is doing at the molecular level.  This can be hard for students to visualize and impossible to show in demonstrations, for students cannot see what the molecules are doing and how they are reacting.  However, through the WISE activity, they are able to do so.  It also provided students to do some investigations that might not have been feasible to do as real labs, whether due to lack of materials or inability to manipulate the heat as needed.  More generally, it was great how WISE allowed students investigate the answers to key questions, rather than simply listening to a lecture were answers or provided or reading a textbook and looking at diagrams.  This interactive, kinesthetic way of learning can be very beneficial for many students.  Lastly, it was interesting that teachers were able to modify these lessons and share them with colleagues.  This collaboration can help teachers to provide the best possible instruction based on the needs of their students.",there were many aspects of the wise activity on thermodynamics that i suspect were very effective in helping students learn the topics.  one aspect was providing students with animations that show what heat is doing at the molecular level.  this can be hard for students to visualize and impossible to show in demonstrations  for students cannot see what the molecules are doing and how they are reacting.  however  through the wise activity  they are able to do so.  it also provided students to do some investigations that might not have been feasible to do as real labs  whether due to lack of materials or inability to manipulate the heat as needed.  more generally  it was great how wise allowed students investigate the answers to key questions  rather than simply listening to a lecture were answers or provided or reading a textbook and looking at diagrams.  this interactive  kinesthetic way of learning can be very beneficial for many students.  lastly  it was interesting that teachers were able to modify these lessons and share them with colleagues.  this collaboration can help teachers to provide the best possible instruction based on the needs of their students.,many aspect wise activity thermodynamics suspect effective help student learn topic aspect provide student animation show heat molecular level hard student visualize impossible show demonstration student cannot see molecule react however wise activity able also provide student investigation feasible real lab due lack material inability manipulate heat need generally great wise allow student investigate answer key question rather simply listen lecture answer provide read textbook look diagram interactive kinesthetic way learning beneficial many student lastly interest teacher able modify lesson share colleague collaboration help teacher provide best possible instruction base need student

Through this, the teacher can understand how the process of thinking and knowledge building are coming together.\r\n2) Conceptual work: As it states, the conceptual work on the WISE is clearly effective since it breaks a big complex concept into small pieces that can be argued and problematized in different perspectives.

For example, a teacher trying to do such an activity without the support of WISE, would not necessarily know how long to remain on any one aspect of the activity, and may move too quickly for some students and too slowly for others.  By using technology, the student drives the speed of learning and is able to adjust that to fit their personal processing speed (within the two 80 min periods given for the activity).",i liked how the wise activity really broke the overall concept into small  manageable steps that slowly built the student's understanding of each sub section of the overall concept  gradually leading students to a full understanding of the main topic.  this type of scaffolding allows stronger students to quickly consolidate their knowledge and build to their new understanding about the topic and allows students in need of more support  to use the stepping stones of the wise program  to give them the essential understanding that they need.  for example  a teacher trying to do such an activity without the support of wise  would not necessarily know how long to remain on any one aspect of the activity  and may move too quickly for some students and too slowly for others.  by using technology  the student drives the speed of learning and is able to adjust that to fit their personal processing speed  within the two  min periods given for the activity .,like wise activity really break overall concept small manageable step slowly build student understanding sub section overall concept gradually leading student full understanding main topic type scaffold allows strong student quickly consolidate knowledge build new understand topic allow student need support use stepping stone wise program give essential understanding need example teacher try activity support wise necessarily know long remain aspect activity move quickly student slowly others use technology student drive speed learning able adjust fit personal processing speed min period give activity

"There are many interesting aspects of the WISE activity that I thought were effective in helping students. The simple fact that students are able to visualize the concepts presented in the experiments, and that students are able to manipulate the elements of the simulation via the WISE activity is, I think, great. And also, Thermodynamics in the Kitchen, makes the otherwise abstract concepts of Thermodynamics more accessible for students since they can directly connect what they learn in class with their immediate environment, that is, their kitchen. And breaking down rather large and dense concepts into manageable chunks through the simulations helps students digest concepts more readily and easily.  ItÈs one way to tell students that Thermodynamics operates around us and itÈs completely another way to show them that it does really work around us by having them experience it. And that is one area where the WISE activity is also successful at. And on top of all that, the WISE platform gives the students scenarios to reflect, collaborate, and engage on. When student were allowed to test their predictions about scenarios in the WISE activities, such as touching actual materials in the classroom, itÈs inquiry based learning at work. Learners are not just given the right answers. Instead, theyÈre up and about investigating, measuring, collaborating and thinking about the possible ways to explain what they observe while at the same time giving them the opportunity to formulate and test their ideas. And keeping a record of what the students has measured, experimented, predicted or reflected on also makes it concrete for learners of what theyÈve learned.

"There were several aspects of the Wise activity that I believed led to learning. First as the students were working through the simulation they had to constantly answer questions and provide feedback. Second as the teacher circulated the classroom she could answer any additional questions student had, or even assess student learning and direct the students as needed. Finally what I found most intriguing is that students were asked to find objects and apply the concepts they had just learned in this case was to touch metals and non metals in the classroom and understand why some feel colder than others even if they are at the same temperature. I noticed a student even had a laser thermometer what I could see in the video this extra part really got the students attention and lead to a deep engagement in the part of the students.
